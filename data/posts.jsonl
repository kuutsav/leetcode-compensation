Honestly my college placements were almost dead. Hardly any companies came and I passed out completely jobless. Watching everyone on LinkedIn post joining updates while I was sitting at home was already painful.\n\nAfter some time I somehow got an opening at a very very small startup. Team of just 4 people. The CTO was 21 years old, extremely arrogant, toxic culture, shouting for small things, chain smoking whole day. Late nights were kind of compulsory there.\n\nMy home was far so I couldn\u2019t stay late every day. Slowly things became bad and one day they just fired me.\n\nThat phase already broke my confidence a lot.\n\nThen by pure luck my placement cell again contacted me for an on-campus edtech company. I still remember that day  I felt maybe god is giving me one more chance. I got 7 LPA (6+1) and joined with full motivation.\n\nBut again things didn\u2019t go well.\n\nThe buddy assigned to train me was from my same batch. He was supposed to give me KT but instead he saw me as competition. He tried everything  highlighting small mistakes, not helping properly, creating negative image.\n\nAt the same time company was already running in heavy loss.\n\nOne fine day there was a massive layoff. Even the CTO got laid off. My name was already in the list because he was close to the manager.\n\nThat day I felt numb. Like I didn\u2019t even have energy to react anymore.\n\nThe only positive thing was that the CTO was impressed with my work and later gave me a LinkedIn recommendation. That\u2019s the only thing that still gives me little confidence.\n\nAfter that I stayed at home for almost 2 months.\n\nThose 2 months were honestly the darkest period of my life.\n\nI was depressed almost daily. Used to overthink at night till morning. There were days I randomly cried without any reason. I kept thinking  did I choose the wrong field, am I not good enough, will my career ever start properly?\n\nThen one day a friend sent me an HR number.\n\nI gave the interview and luckily cleared it.\n\nThey knew my situation very well and offered me only 7 LPA  all fixed. No variable, no negotiation. I still accepted because at that point I just wanted stability.\n\nNow it\u2019s been around 10 months here.\n\nI\u2019m working as a sole developer on a project, handling everything myself. Learning a lot, but because of my past experiences I constantly live in fear. Every meeting notification gives me anxiety thinking what if it\u2019s bad news again.\n\nI really want to switch to a better product-based company and put my career on the right track.\n\nBut I\u2019m not getting many calls. Resume hardly gets shortlisted. Slowly I lost consistency in DSA again because mentally I feel exhausted.\n\nMy biggest fear is  what if I get laid off again?\n\nHow will I justify these short stints everywhere? Won\u2019t recruiters think I\u2019m the problem?\n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m already late while everyone else is moving ahead.\n\nOne more thing that keeps bothering me a lot\u2026\n\nMy cousin brother is from a Tier 1 college and he got 37 LPA directly from campus. I\u2019m genuinely happy for him but at the same time it hurts. It constantly makes me feel how far behind I am in my career being from Tier 3.\n\nI keep thinking  will I ever catch up in life? Will I ever reach that pace again or is the gap already too big?\n\nI really want to fight again but right now I feel confused, scared and tired at the same time.\n\nPlease guide me like your younger brother.\n\nIs my situation still recoverable?\nHow should I plan my switch?\nShould I restart DSA again?\nHow do I explain all this honestly in interviews?\n\nAny advice would genuinely mean a lot \ud83d\ude4f\n\n![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/da6ef485-a160-438c-9dba-f0ef8b11a99c_1769367121.4020755.png)\n"}

The process consisted of three elimination based rounds \u2014 two technical rounds followed by a hiring manager round.\n\nRound 1 (Medium Level):\nThe interview began with a discussion about my technical skill set and the technology stack I have worked on. Following this, I was asked a DSA problem on spiral traversal of an N\u00d7M matrix. After solving it, I was given another problem on detecting a loop in a linked list, along with an explanation and mathematical proof of the approach used (Floyd\u2019s Cycle Detection Algorithm).\n\nRound 2 (Hard Level \u2013 Core CS + DSA):\nThis round was conducted by a senior engineer and began unexpectedly with questions on Operating System concepts. I was asked to explain topics such as defragmentation, thrashing, memory management, and virtual memory. The interviewer went into depth on each concept and asked follow-up questions to test my understanding.\n\nNext, the discussion moved to C++ fundamentals. I was asked about the auto storage class, pointers and const pointers, memory layout of C++ programs, and heap vs stack memory. I was also asked to explain virtual functions with an example and describe their real-world use case. Additional questions covered lambda functions, function pointers (including writing code for them), and the volatile keyword.\n\nThe interviewer also asked about recursion, including writing code to reverse a string using recursion, and discussed process scheduling, where I was asked about the best scheduling algorithm and specifically about Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ).\n\nConcurrency and synchronization were another focus area. I was questioned in detail about mutexes, semaphores, and spinlocks, including:\n\n- Differences between them\n\n- Internal working\n\n- Where and when spinlocks are preferred\n\nAfter the theory section, I was given a DSA problem on swapping nodes pairwise in a linked list. I had to explain my approach and write the fully working code, and the interviewer asked follow-up questions based on my solution.\n\nRound 3 (Medium Level):\nThe hiring manager began by asking how the previous rounds went and then moved into a resume-based discussion. I was asked to explain the projects I had worked on in my previous organization, the role I played in them, and how my contributions helped improve runtime performance through code optimizations.\n\nThe discussion then shifted to object-oriented design. I was asked to explain the Singleton design pattern, how to ensure thread safety in its implementation, and to write the corresponding code.\n\nAfter that, I was given a few DSA and design-oriented problems, including:\n\n- Given numbers from 1 to n, finding the missing and repeating number\n\n- Deleting an element from an array\n\n- Deleting a node from a linked list\n\n- Designing a Memory Leak Analyzer in C++, where I was asked to explain the high-level design (Object Oriented) and approach\n\nThis was followed by a managerial and behavioral discussion, where I was asked about my problem-solving approach, how I handle challenges in a team environment, and my expectations from the role. The interviewer also discussed the team\u2019s work and gave an overview of the responsibilities associated with the position.\n"}

I start coding the problem but at the end there are some logical errors for which some of the test cases are not passing, if i get more time maybe I can solve moreover there is no support or proper communication from the interviewer side he is just chilling by closing his camera all the time. I have done this problem a long time back but during interview i got pretty nervous by seeing a hard tag problem which i am not expecting, by this time it is close to 1Hour so he says it's ok that's all from my side and you can leave.\r\n\r\n"}

Is \u20b915.3 LPA a lowball for an SDE 1 at Nike Bangalore with 3.5 YOE? (I tried negotiating, but HR said this is final).\r\n2. Is it worth taking a \"savings cut\" to get the Nike brand name on my resume?\r\n3.

Previous interview experiences were really key in cracking these rounds. Hence doing my bit by sharing my experience. \n\nI have a total of 3 yrs of experience of working at quick commerce startups (swiggy and zepto)\n\nFirst round: DM\u2019ed a recruiter looking for openings, soon within 3 days she shared a hacker rank link. This contained 2 DSA questions (both medium). First question was a binary search based and another on trees. Post that there were some LP based questions (choice based questions).\n\nIt took my recruiter almost 2 weeks to get back and another 10 days to schedule an interview. \n\nSecond Round: This was a System design round, the objective was to design an auction platform. Interviewer focussed primarily on DB schemas, scaling and designing low latency apis (caching). No LP was asked instead the interviewer asked to explain any interesting project from my past work.\n\nFollow ups: \n1. How do you handle edits to bids ( I suggesting allowing multiple bids rather than providing an edit option.) \n2. How would you support a near real-time leaderboard (redis sorted sets)\n3. How would you identify/track the winning bid (can\u2019t rely on redis as source of truth)\n\nI relied on hello interview for my prep, although I hadn\u2019t previously solved this question I was able to come up with an acceptable solution in time.\n\nVerdict: Passed, got good feedback from the interviewer.\n\nThird round: LLD discussion with Hiring manager, although this was supposed to be a LLD round, the interviewer primarily focused on my work ex at zepto and my design choices from my projects. We also discussed if we could build an inventory service using NoSQL (zepto uses SQL). Last 10 mins were focused on explaining what design pattern was used in some of my old projects. No LPs asked in this round.\n\nVerdict: Got positive feedback. I was worried cuz interviewer never asked any LLD question.\n\nRound 3: DSA round, a younger SDE-2 was the interviewer. First question - Implement an interface to navigate browser history. \nSecond question - Implement basic arithmetic operations  like +,-,*,/ without using any inbuilt functions.\n\nI used golang to write the code, and was able to implement both of these in time. Although the interviewer wasn\u2019t aware of this language and I had to explain the basics to him. Also I felt the interviewer was neither interested in understanding a diff language nor was able to ask follow ups properly \n\nVerdict: Positive but slightly hesitant.\n\nBar raiser: Was asked questions based on LPs related to ownership. 2 DSA questions, 1) rotten oranges (graph BFS) 2) Asteriod collisions (Stack)\n\nHeard back from the recruiter in two days, got an offer.\n\nOffer - 46L base, 29L joining bonus (over 2 years) and 38L esops\n"}

Google\u2019s interviews were conducted via Google Meet with an online editor (no syntax highlighting; code was written manually). We started with some brief small talk and a quick overview of my background, then moved straight into the problems.\n\nFirst Round \u2013 Coding\n\nThis was an interval-related problem, similar in spirit to Meeting Rooms III (roughly similar). I spent about 10 minutes clarifying the problem requirements. I then presented an optimal solution. During the dry run, I fixed a small bug, simulated two test cases, and discussed time and space complexity. The interviewer was very satisfied with my solution.\n\nSecond Round \u2013 Coding\n\nThe task was to handle multiple interval queries on an array and determine whether the subarray within each interval satisfies the condition that adjacent elements alternate in parity.\nThe approach was to perform a one-time preprocessing step to build an auxiliary array that marks whether adjacent elements have the same parity. For each query, we simply check whether there exists any pair of adjacent elements with the same parity within the interval, which allows each query to be answered in constant time.\n\nThird Round \u2013 Coding\n\nGiven an array nums, find the shortest contiguous subarray that contains at least k distinct integers. If no such subarray exists, return -1.\n\nFourth Round \u2013 Behavioral / Project Discussion\n\nThis round focused entirely on discussing my personal projects and internship experiences, along with several behavioral (BQ) questions, future plans, and the classic question: Why Google? There was no coding in this round.\n\nHR Feedback\nHR mentioned that the feedback so far has been positive, and I am currently in the team match stage.\n\n"}

In this article, I\u2019ll share my entire journey \u2014 from shortlisting to interviews \u2014 along with some preparation tips and personal takeaways for future aspirants.\n\n\nThere was resume shortlisting or rather cg based shortlisting. Cg criteria was around 7.8 iirc. People above that were shortlisted for OT. It was open for circuital departments only\n\nOT:\n\nOT had 3 sections:\n\n(i) DSA- There were 2 DSA questions, different for everyone. For me,\n\nYou are given a string with 0 and 1, and whenever you get 01, you need to make it 10. So in one iteration of string all 01 gets converted to 10, Every iteration counts to 1 second, we had to return the min no of seconds required so that there will be no more swaps.\nEg \u2014 10101\n\nSo in sec 1- 11010\n\nSec 2- 11100\n\nAns- 2\n\n2. Graph question was there, i dont remember it exactly, but you were given a start node and an end node, you were also given some nodes which had points, so you needed to start from the starting node and cover all the nodes with points and reach end node in minimum time.\n\nI just brute forced it by taking a set for every possible path, it passed all the available test cases.\n\nThere were only 3 visible test cases.\n\n(ii) CS Fundamentals + ML MCQs- These questions covered networking, OS, DBMS, ML as well. Questions were really good, so if you haven\u2019t seen them before you won\u2019t be able to attempt it.\n\n(iii) General Maths, Reasoning, Comprehension MCQs- Basic maths, 3 comprehension paragraphs and a few reasoning questions were there.\n\nIdk how many exact questions were there but ig around 30 MCQs were there.\n\nI solved both the DSA problems, well brute forced it tbh. Then MCQs were mostly repeated so I had that figured out as well.\n\nTip \u2014 Try to finish OT asap, solving it quickly increases your chances of getting a PI call.\n\nPIs:\n\nI had 3 rounds. Pis were offline, pen and paper, so the paper that was used to solve questions is stapled along with the resume and goes to the next rounds for reference. PIs slot is important as people finishing their pis first were mostly the ones that got selected, so again a bit of luck involved. I will put some tips in between and some generic ones at the end.\n\nPI 1:\n\nI was a bit nervous, but as soon as I entered the room, the interviewer shook my hand, gave his intro and made me a bit comfortable. He started to take a look at my resume, he started with the CS minor that i had in my resume. (Tip \u2014 if you\u2019re non CS, minor in cs are a big advantage is what i felt). He then started asking me what all courses I have done in CS minor. I said DSA and DBMS going on this sem, but I also mentioned I know OS and all as I did it on my own. So he asked me the difference between paging and segmentation, what is fragmentation, where does internal fragmentation happen. He then moved on to DSA, where he gave me a simple min heap problem saying to find top k most frequent elements. He aslo asked binary search in matrix question. He asked me the difference between dijkastra and bellman ford, TC of dijkastra, which algo is bellman ford based upon greedy or dp. He then moved to DBMS, asked me to write a simple SQL query, pretty basic. (Tip- Try to do SQL top 50 problems on Leetcode, it was a big help). I asked him a bit of a generic question like what do you expect of us interns at Oracle. Overall PI overall went for about 40\u201345 mins.\n\nPI 2:\n\nFor PI2 again the interviewer started with his intro and asked me for my intro. Later on he looked at my resume. Also he looked at the paper on which i had my last PI, it had everything covered but my projects, so he started with my projects. Asked me to explain Lynx 2.0, and another of my React Native projects with node backend. Asked a bit about what I worked on in Lynx. For the next 15\u201320 mins he was just asking about REST Apis. To and fro. His questions were not direct, for example I remember he asked me what I would do before getting a response from the backend and showing it on my frontend. By this he wanted to know about status codes lmao. So yes all about rest apis, status codes, different http methods, difference between put post, idempotency of rest api, about rest architecture in general. (Tip \u2014 Know your projects, its techstack end to end, you don\u2019t know what the interviewer might dive deep into). After this he asked me an oops question. About polymorphism, its types and some examples. And in the end I asked him about his oracle experience, he went on for about 5 mins. PI lasted about 30- 35 mins.\n\nPI 3 (HR) :\n\nI was told to have lunch after PI2 so just after returning, i got PI 3 call, this was very chill, an old guy just asking me questions like what is ICE? Why NITT? Why do something that is not your core? Why interested in CS?\n\nAnd then some questions on Javascript, React Native and what was my experience in working in a team.\n\nHe asked me twice do i know ML? I replied no, I am planning to explore it as soon as I land an internship. So yeah pretty chill. I asked him one generic question in the end as well.\n\nSome generic PI tips:\n\nBe confident. Even if you don\u2019t know anything, use words like i haven\u2019t explored it and show curiosity that you\u2019re interested in learning it.\nDSA questions will mostly be easy and something that you might have already seen so explain properly, tc, approach everything.\nAlways always ask some generic question at the end of PI, this makes some impact.\nNever say i dont know or be silent during pis. Lets say you have some tuff dsa problem, while solving think out loud dont just go in a shell and then say after you\u2019ve figured out the problem, they are more interested in knowing how you approach a problem.\nOracle sometimes asks puzzles as well, it didn\u2019t happen to me but yeah please do gfg top 50 puzzles.\n\nAll the very best :)\n\n#Oracle #InternshipExperience #NITTrichy #CampusPlacement #SoftwareEngineering #DSA #CareerJourney\n\n\n"}

Can folks working in Singapore transfer to any of the teams in EMEA / US?  Is there a minimum time period before one can apply for a transfer?\r\n\r\n2. Given the Chinese connection, will having TikTok on my resume / record pose as a risk in the future if I ever look to move to western countries (Europe / US) for jobs / higher studies? Not sure how much truth there is to this - but I've heard people in the US face trouble finding jobs after working at Bytedance / TikTok. Would help if someone could shed some light on this.\r\n\r\nWould really appreciate any answers to my questions above.

Leetcode Discuss section helped me understand the interview pattern and prepare for it in short time.\n\nThe interview happened as a drive with many candidates joining in a zoom call and sent to different rooms. There were 3 rounds which can happen in any order.\n\n### R1: System Design - HLD\nThey have hackerrank whiteboard set up with structure for interview and asked me to design a Rate Limiter. I have not did this question before but with the understanding I had asked for Functional & Non-functional requirements and defined the APIs and Entities. Then went ahead with drawing a simple system with Load Balancer, Services and using DB to track requests. I had follow up questions on handling failures and DB being down. I had explained and communicated this can be scaled up to using API Gateway with Redis for a distributed system. Overall it went well and interviewer seemed happy.\n\nI later saw that there are various algos as well for implementing the request tracker. As I understand, it might depend on how we drive. It's good to be aware of the basic system asked & if we talk more, they ask more :)\n\n### R2: Behavioral : \nStandard resume and situational based questions. Be confident and relate answers to the questions asked and keep it crisp.\n\n### R3: Code review + DSA : \nBe thorough with Java Basics to highlight and suggest the fixes.

So I asked the next recruiter to get my feedback for the role I was selected for. Both recruiters agreed on their chat or messaging and have shared my feedback with the hiring manager so as they said that I will get the role in some team hiring for Bangalore location. Now I am being patient for the result, as holidays are in the middle so response will be typically slow is my assumption anyway. \n\nBut what do you think will I get this through ? Will I receive the response from their end ? I truly assured them that I will be joining MS, I have different offers and some interviews in the pipeline from Cohesity, Rubrik, Oracle and Amazon. But even if I clear any of them I would still be inclined towards MS because of the stability/perks.\n\nAnother question is while the role was for SDE-2 I don't know the Level, is it l61 or l62 ( I think L62) as I have 4 years of experience now.  What should be my target range if my CTC currently is 39 LPA total.  What can I expect from the market standards or what should I pitch to them ?\nExpecting some wonderful answers.\n\nThanks and Best of Luck folks!"}

The interviewer guided me through the thought process, after which I was able to implement the solution correctly.\n\nLLD:\nI do not recall the exact problem statement, but we discussed the design approach, class responsibilities, and extensibility. The interviewer seemed satisfied with the overall approach.\n\nMicroservices Discussion:\nWe had a detailed discussion on Kafka internals, including how producers, consumers, partitions, and offsets work. It turned into a healthy technical discussion rather than a Q&A, and overall the round went well.\n\nRound 2 \u2013 DSA + Project Discussion (Best Round)\n\nThis round had two DSA problems.\n\n1. JSON Internals Count\nGiven a JSON string, I was asked to find the number of nested objects.\nExample:\n\nInput: {{}{}}  \nOutput: 2\n\n\nI solved this by parsing the structure and tracking nesting logic.\n\n2. Power and Recursive Digit Sum\nGiven n, compute 2^n, then recursively sum the digits of the result until a single digit remains.\nConstraints: 0 \u2264 n \u2264 10^9.\n\nI discussed the mathematical optimization instead of brute force exponentiation and implemented the solution efficiently.\n\nAfter solving both problems, we discussed my current projects in detail. The interviewer seemed impressed, and this was my strongest round.\n\nRound 3 \u2013 LLD + Resume Project \n\nThis round focused on Low-Level Design and one of the projects from my resume.\n\nLLD \u2013 Music Player Design:\nI was asked to implement a music player supporting:\n\nPlay\n\nNext / Previous\n\nRepeat song\n\nRepeat playlist\n\nI coded the solution in an IDE. The interviewer mentioned that Java might not be my primary language( which is correct), so minor hiccups were acceptable.\nHe pointed out that there were too many if-else conditions. I refactored the design using a pattern. Initially, I mentioned it as the Strategy pattern, but the interviewer clarified that I implemented State pattern which was more appropriate here, which I agreed with.\n\nOverall, the interviewer was positive about the design evolution and thought process.\n\nHR Discussion\n\nHR discussed my current compensation and mentioned that they would consider an offer by incrementing over my current base salary.\n\nCurrent Compensation:\n\nBase: \u20b916.7 LPA\n\nBonus: \u20b91.6 LPA\n\nESOPs: $2,500\n\n**I asked for 30-32 base but she mentioned team will contact me but they are willing to pay 25-30 LPA.

One was a simple array-based LeetCode Easy, one was based on graphs along the lines of finding the best route a salesman can take to minimize operations, and one was based on backtracking using dynamic programming and can be called as a LeetCode Hard.\r\n\r\nRound 2 \u2192 Technical Round 1 (DSA):\r\nI was asked an easy-to-medium scheduling question that could have been solved using arrays or using heaps and hash maps for an optimal solution. We had to write and explain our pseudocode to the panelist in 30 minutes, with 5 minutes for cross-questions on its time and space complexity and approach.\r\n\r\nRound 3 \u2192 Technical Round 2 (LLD):\r\nI was asked a LLD question similar to standard LeetCode design questions (Example: https://leetcode.com/problems/simple-bank-system/description/ ) where the function names and parameters are given and you have to fill in their working. The question was on ride sharing, with functions like add rides, find ride, book ride, cancel ride, etc. We had 1 hour to code it and run one test case. If you ran the test case successfully, you would have passed. After this, for 30 minutes, I was asked about the basics of OOPs, SOLID principles, and OS concepts like mutex and race conditions.\r\n\r\nRound 4 \u2192 Hiring Manager Round:\r\nI had a panelist with around 10+ years of experience. Here, I was grilled on my resume projects and on every little keyword. He wanted to know why I used a particular approach and asked me to come up with a better approach, along with why I used a specific tech stack and whether it was feasible in a real-life scenario. Along with this, I was asked standard HR questions.\r\n\r\nResult: Rejected\r\n\r\nEven though I feel that I did pretty well in all my rounds, since they only took one candidate for my role in SDE, I think I was rejected due to my HM round performance. Overall, it was a good learning experience for my next interviews with other big companies."}

Coming in with 2.4 years of experience, I was excited about the promise of working with cutting-edge technologies: Java, Spring Boot, Python, Flask, APIs, MongoDB, and exposure to AI-driven systems.\n\nThe reality? It's been quite different.\n\n## The Problem: Expectation vs. Reality\n\n**What I was promised:**\n- Backend development with AI exposure\n- Modern tech stack and architectural challenges\n\n**What I'm actually doing:**\n\n- Will be taking over mostly legacy codebase work\n- Ad-hoc job monitoring and maintenance tasks\n- Limited technical growth opportunities\n\nThis mismatch between what was sold to me during the interview and what I'm actually working on has been frustrating. I joined expecting to build systems at scale and learn from experienced engineers, but instead, I'm maintaining legacy code and handling operational tasks.\n\n## The Complicating Factor: Promotion Eligibility\n\nIn my investment bank, the promotion cycles are tied to tenure. I've already missed the current cycle, which means:\n- I won't be eligible for my next promotion until I have 3.5-4 years of experience\n- Currently sitting at 2.4 years, so that's another 1-1.5 years minimum\n- There's no clear path to SD2 (or equivalent) in the near term\n\nThis timeline feels long, especially when I'm not getting the technical growth I expected.\n\n## The External Offer\n\nJust today, I received an offer from a startup:\n- **Base salary:** 35 LPA\n- **Equity:** LESOPs valued over 4 years\n\n**My concern:** After a 4-5 month stint at my current company, jumping to a startup at 35 LPA (when I'm already at 27 LPA base + bonus) feels like a step backward, even with equity factored in. The startup offer doesn't account for the 5 lakh variable bonus I'm getting now, making it less attractive on paper.\n\nDespite the situation, I have been rigorously doing DSA, LLD & HLD daily. \n\n\n## Questions for the Community\n\n- **Take the startup offer and bet on the upside?**\n- **Stay at the investment bank and wait for the work to improve?**\n- **Explore other opportunities?**\n- **Something else entirely?**\n\nAny insights on career strategy, compensation evaluation, or long-term planning would be greatly appreciated. I want to make a decision that sets me up for sustainable growth, not just a quick paycheck.\n\n---\n\n**Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. Thanks!**"}

[K most frequent elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)\r\n2. [Generate all subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/)\r\n\r\nWas able to solve both questions. Interviewer asked about time complexity and space complexity for each solution.

[Rotten oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/description/) variation.\r\n2. [k distance nodes in binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/).\r\n\r\nWas able to solve the first question easily. For second question I knew the approach where we store the parent of each node in a map and then do a BFS from given node.\r\nHowever interviewer wanted me to come up with an approach without storing parent. \r\nIt took me some time to figure out the recursive approach as I had never solved this problem with recursive approach before. The interviewer asked about Time and space complexity of all these solutions. I answered it and he looked satisfied with the code and other answers and wrapped up.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Round 3 (Bar raiser):(Next wednesday)**\r\n\r\nI was told by HR that only three LP questions would be asked. I prepared my stories for FAQs.  \r\nBut Interviewer gave me one DSA problem:\r\n1. Given the root of a tree, a source and a target. Find out the shortest path from source to target and print the path in given way:\r\n    'A' - If moving to left child\r\n    'B' - If moving to right child\r\n    'C' - If moving to parent\r\n\r\neg:\r\n 2\r\n/ \\\\\r\n1 4\r\nsrc: 1 target: 4\r\n\r\noutput: \"CB\"\r\n\r\nI came up with an approach to store the parent of each node and then do a BFS from src and keep track of path. Interviewer asked me to optimise the solution. Suggested me not to use any extra space.\r\nIt took me around 30 mins to reach to its solution. I proposed LCA approach where I would first find LCA of both nodes and then simple dfs would have worked with slight modification for path printing. \r\n\r\n2. After this, a couple of LP scenario based question were asked. Sounded more like formality. However I gave the answers which I had prepared. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# **Result:**\r\nI was not sure of the outcome as my third round did not look good to me. Even I had solved the problem but it took me multiple approaches and 30 mins to reach to the desired solution. \r\nThe result was declared exactly one week after the interview and I got the email saying **\"Congratulations you got the job\"**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# **Compensation**\r\n\r\n**Current:**\r\ncompany: Fintech MNC\r\nbase: 13.4 lpa\r\njoining bonus: 3L\r\nRelocation: 1L\r\nperformance : 10-15% of base.\r\nYOE: 1 year 4 months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Offered:**\r\nBase: 19,17,000 lpa\r\njoining bonus(year 1): 6,47,000\r\njoining bonus(year 2): 5,18,000\r\nRSUs: 15,56,000 (Vested in 4 years, 5%, 15%, 40%, 40%)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thank you to the leetcode community**.

You\u2019re required to live in the Mumbai region even if your role is fully remote and your team never goes to the office. Since most of the company already works remotely, you might end up staying in Mumbai without any real need to be there\u2014while dealing with the high cost of living.\n\nThe work culture can also be tough. Long days are pretty normal, sometimes stretching to 12 hours, and on busy days it\u2019s hard to even take a proper lunch break. These issues, along with concerns about the Mumbai policy, don\u2019t always seem to get the attention they need from management.\n\nOn top of that, the attitude from top management often feels disconnected from what employees actually go through.

Both got rescheduled because of unavailablity of Interviewer. Though disheartened at that moment this worked out in my favour. As i wouldn't have been able to clear the System design at that time.\r\n\r\nDSA Round (27th May)\r\n\r\n    Only 1 interview was scheduled on this day.\r\n    First 10-15 mins went for the LP discussion. Recuriter informed me which 2 LP i have to prepare, so formed the STAR pattern answers for 8-10 questions.\r\n    1st Question was variation of Max Island question, where we can change one 0 to 1 in the matrix and we need to find the largest island possible. Solved by finding all the components and greedily checked for each 0 what will the max island size if its changed to 1.\r\n    2nd Questions was simple hashing based, don't remember the exact question but we only had a discussion on this no implementation as time was over.\r\n    Self Assesment - Hire/Strong Hire(Not sure because of the last question)\r\n\r\nLLD Round (17th June)\r\n\r\n    The round was initially scheduled for 10th but got rescheduled at the last moment.\r\n    Recuriter informed the 2 LP i need to prepare, went with the same approach as last time.\r\n    Initial 15 mins went in the LP discussion.\r\n    I was asked to design the Issue management system(Different priority, Escalations, Wait Queue).\r\n    Overall round went well and interviewer was satisfied with the solution.\r\n    Self Assesment - Strong Hire\r\n\r\nHLD Round (17th June)\r\n\r\n    Because of multiple rescheds i asked recruiter to schedule both rounds on same day if possible.\r\n    Recuriter informed the 2 LP i need to prepare, went with the same approach as last time.\r\n    I was asked to design Parking Lot system.\r\n    Since this was a HLD round and the question seems more like an LLD, i got a bit confused and ended up discussing the LLD, interviewer was supportive and still asked meaningful questions as per LLD.\r\n    Last 15 mins were utilised for LP, this time i was asked 4 questions based on the 2 LP i prepared.\r\n    Self Verdict - Lean Hire/Hire (Doubtfule because of LLD discussion in HLD)\r\n\r\nBar Raiser (23rd June)\r\n\r\n    Got a mail after two days that a bar raiser is scheduled and it will be based on HLD. I expected the same because of the above reasons and was preparing for the same.\r\n    First 10-15 mins went into LP discussion.\r\n    I was asked to design Amazon Locker System. Next 40-45 mins went very well. I was designing it for the first time but bits and pieces which i learned from other systems all got utilised here. For eg : I learnt about proximity service in some other question and it just fit well in this problem as well.\r\n    Interviewer asked few questions on the concurrency part and scaling, which i answered properly.\r\n    Overall i was happy from my performance and interviewer also seems to be satisfied.\r\n    Self Verdict - Strong Hire (Mostly because i was proud of what i designed)\r\n\r\nGot the congratulation mail after 2 days.\r\n\r\nHad verbal offer discussion two days after.\r\n\r\nVerbal Offer:\r\nBase Pay - 43\r\nBonus - 15.3 + 12\r\nRSU - 210\r\n\r\nTotal First Year CTC - ~60\r\n\r\nI feel like the offer is a bit low ball. Tried negotiating but recruiter is firm that they can't go over 61. I also had an offer with ~55LPA (Though i didn't liked the profile that much)\r\n\r\nLocation - Bangalore\r\nTeam - Amazon Fresh related Team \r\n\r\nIf you want to give a faang type coding mock interview you can book same here : https://www.meetapro.com/provider/mock-interview/1083393\r\nUse code LEETCODE75 for 75% off."}

For the backend practical the stack chosen was Python. The task was similar to implementing a lightweight load balancer; you had to clone a specified project from GitHub. Required implementation points included:\na. Worker state management (e.g. active/overloaded/unreachable)\nb. Task queue and priority scheduling mechanism\nc. How to support scalability (for example, dynamic joining of worker nodes)\n\nYou needed to design from perspectives such as task-dispatch logic, worker heartbeat mechanism, failover strategy, etc., and produce code within a limited time \u2014 the bar was fairly high.\n\n---\n\nRound 2 \u2014 Coding: Clock-hand angle\nThe coding round was done live on CoderPad and you had to explain your approach. The problem itself is not hard but you must handle edge cases and clearly explain the logic. Given a time string like \u201c3:45\u201d, compute the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand.\n\nYou can apply a direct formula, but the interviewer wanted you to explain where each part of the angle calculation comes from. The idea: the minute hand moves 6\u00b0 per minute; the hour hand moves 30\u00b0 per hour plus 0.5\u00b0 per minute. So compute each hand\u2019s angle relative to 12 o\u2019clock from the input hour and minute, take the absolute difference, and if it\u2019s greater than 180\u00b0 subtract it from 360\u00b0 to get the smaller angle.\n\nFollow-up: how would you adjust the formula if the input also includes seconds or milliseconds?\n\n---\n\nRound 3 \u2014 System Design\nThis round was a training session: a smiling Japanese interviewer shadowed a Chinese candidate. The task was to design a Ticketmaster-like system. You can follow Alex Xu\u2019s methodology; however, the candidate said: \u201cLet\u2019s not waste time on back-of-the-envelope calculations \u2014 forget about distributed systems. Let\u2019s map the user flow clearly and draw a diagram with all components.\u201d\n\nRequirements included:\na. How to handle flash-sale scenarios where many users try to buy tickets in a short time\nb. How to implement a timeout on the purchase page and what to do if payment is not completed within the timeout\nc. How to handle the situation when tickets are sold out\nd. How to guarantee that users who completed payment will definitely receive tickets\ne. How to implement a waitlist that notifies the next-in-line people when tickets are returned\n\n---\n\nRound 4 \u2014 BQ + Coding\nBehavioral questions were standard:\n\n1. \u201cTell me about a time you had to learn something quickly.\u201d Show structured learning ability \u2014 e.g., using API docs, codebase walkthroughs, shadowing colleagues, building a proof of concept (POC).\n2. \u201cTell me about a time you disagreed with a teammate or manager.\u201d Support your stance with data-driven or customer-impact reasons, show you can accept valid feedback, and turn the result into a win-win.\n3. \u201cTell me about a challenging project you worked on.\u201d Use the STAR structure to tell a business-impactful story; in the Action section quantify your measures (for example, \u201cimproved performance by 40%,\u201d \u201creduced latency to P99 < 200ms\u201d).\n\nThe coding problem: given a tree where you only know each node\u2019s list of children, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes. Several approaches were discussed: first, run DFS to compute each node\u2019s parent and depth, then raise the deeper node upward until depths match and move both up until they meet. Another approach: run a DFS from the root where each node returns a pair of booleans indicating whether it can reach the two target nodes; the first node that returns (true, true) is the LCA. Ideas, clarifications, comments, and test cases were all explained in detail.\nOther Scale AI interview experiences you can refer to [this](https://programhelp.net/vo/scale-ai-interview-process-explained-questions-rounds-amp-tips/)."}

The interviewer was Chinese, and after a brief self-introduction, we moved into behavioral questions. They mainly drilled into my r\u00e9sum\u00e9: briefly describe your internship projects, what you learned from them, what the most challenging project was, how team communication was handled within the project, what role you played, etc. I talked about these for around 20 minutes. After that, we moved on to the coding part.\n\nCoding:\nSelect a subset of videos such that the sum of the durations of any two consecutively selected videos does not exceed the user\u2019s attention span, and maximize the total watch time.\n\nApproach:\nUse dynamic programming. Let dp[i][last] represent the maximum total watch time considering the first i videos, where the last selected video has index last.\n\nIf we don\u2019t choose the current video:\ndp[i][last] = dp[i - 1][last]\n\nIf we choose the current video and the sum of its duration with the previous selected one is \u2264 attention span:\ndp[i][i] = dp[i - 1][last] + duration[i]\nTake max(dp[n][*]) as the result.\n\nThe follow-up question was how to handle the case where repeated viewing of the same video is allowed. The state transition needs an additional branch for repeated selections, but this may introduce cycles, so limits must be imposed.\n\nTikTok is very familiar with this format \u2014 you only move on to the next round after passing the previous one. Their process is quite fast; usually they notify you the next day. Many of my peers who I\u2019ve been helping mock interviews for also passed rounds 1 and 2. If you\u2019re unsure about TikTok interviews, prepare in advance: the whole process includes BQ, coding, clarifications, walking through your approach, comments, follow-ups, etc. Speed is usually not an issue. Recently Google, Stripe, TikTok, Uber and a few others have been interviewing quite frequently."}

The prompt is very long, but the logic itself is simple. We read six fields from a CSV file and verify that all fields are non-empty.\r\n\r\nPart 2 \u2014 High-Risk Rule Validation\r\n\r\nOn top of the basic transaction information, this part introduces two core risk-control rules:\r\n\r\nAmount rule: the transaction amount must fall within the business-defined normal range.\r\n\r\nPayment-method rule: the payment method must not appear in the blocked method list.\r\n\r\nIf a transaction violates any of these conditions, it is flagged as SUSPICIOUS.\r\n\r\nPart 3 \u2014 User Behavior Matching\r\n\r\nThis section requires validating whether the transaction aligns with the user\u2019s behavioral baseline. We ensure that at least 50% of the behavioral attributes\u2014such as commonly used spending countries, typical time ranges, and average transaction-amount intervals\u2014match the user\u2019s historical behavior.\r\n\r\nImplementation requires feature extraction, normalization, and computing a match ratio.\r\nIf the current transaction\u2019s match ratio is below 50%, it is classified as a behavior mismatch and flagged as SUSPICIOUS.\r\n\r\nPart 4 \u2014 Smart Fraud Error Reporting\r\n\r\nThe final section implements smart error reporting, replacing the vague label \u201cSUSPICIOUS\u201d with specific error codes. The system outputs up to two error codes according to priority. If there are no issues, it outputs \u201cOK\u201d.\r\nThe output report must maintain column alignment for readability.\r\nIf you need more interview questions related to Stripe, you can refer to my leetcode homepage\r\n"}

Connected components of graph\r\n2. Bit Manipulation \r\n3. DP problem\r\n### Online Assessment 2\r\nThis was unique round compared to that of typical coding rounds, had one coding question and then system design round for 45 min.\r\n1. Dynamic Programming question - weighted job scheduling which is classic DP problem with Binary Search.\r\n2. System Design round -\r\nTo give you context I was asked to design the backend system for a threading feature inside a chat app like Slack or Microsoft Teams that lets users reply directly to a specific message in a channel without cluttering the main chat feed.\r\nBased on this problem statements 3 questions were asked which include designing non-functional features, Data model and relationships and then APIs and it's core functionality. These more or less covers the entire system design part.\r\n### Technical round\r\n1. This round was entirely based on the Online Assessment 2 round held for 70-80 min roughly.\r\nFirstly, on the DSA question which was asked they start by asking why did you choose this approach, is there any other alternative and how did you draw to a conclusion that only this works.\r\nIn short, you need to present your thinking ability and insights and present with some of test cases.\r\nAlso, share your thoughts about the Edge cases. \r\n2. On system design part, first I was asked to explain about the flow of building this feature and then questions on non-functional design features and their importance. Also I was asked to draw the ER model of the entire data bases which are gonna be used in building this feature. Asked to optimize the some of key features in the implementation part as well and was asked to write the code for API calls.\r\n\r\n##### I was rejected after this round.\r\n##### My learnings (what I feel went wrong) -\r\n1. Coming to DSA, it went good I explained my approach from bruteforce to optimization using DP very well.\r\n2. System Design is what I feel lacked, Asked about methods for durability of the data bases I explained about replicas, Write-Ahead logs and Backups but asked on more alternatives I stuck there. And also while designing ER model I feel that I was bit under-confident, and was asked to write API calls, I called two attributes where it can be done with calling one itself.\r\nThese are the parts where I missed and answered remaining all of them but learnings are always know all the alternative methods as well and be confident on what you're designing along with valid explanations.\r\n\r\nThough I didn't make it but I had idea of next rounds.\r\n\r\n### Mangerial Round\r\nComplete resume grill and can expect any type of questions. Be prepared!\r\n\r\n### HR round\r\nHR questions and assessing your work style and culture fit.\r\n\r\nAll the very best!! Let's crack it. I hope added some value for your time.\r\n"}

Typical follow ups like what if we want to distribute this over a fleet of servers etc etc.\r\n- Onsite\r\n    -   Bar Raiser\r\n        - In depth conversation related to your experience, design discussions around your projects and a bunch of behavioral questions.

He really wanted to me code in one pass without using a map. Even if the time and space complexity was the same for my approach, he wanted me to code in a way he wanted. This seemed a bit weird to me because that really does not test anything apart have you memorized leetcode answer keys. ---- [ **Weak Hire :D** ]\r\n    -   Hiring Manager\r\n        - Similar to Bar raiser round, a bunch of standard behavioral questions. What is the hardest project you have done? Your role? How you resolve conflicts etc etc. The interesting thing here was this interview ended pretty soon. My background and the project I highlight is a research based project and I worked on building the MVP for it. The hiring manager and also the Bar raiser to some extent, were looking for a typical distributed systems project where the challenges are around scale. The project I selected did not have these (I mentioned these explicitly). This project had mostly non-technical challenges which I tried my best to put in a 'Staff' level expectation. The Hiring manager realized this and ended the interview in almost 15 mins. We were just chitchatting for the next 15-20 mins :D ----  [ **Strong Hire** ]\r\n    -   Coding\r\n        - 2 behavioral questions\r\n        - 2 coding questions\r\n            - First question, given networks of 2 friends represented by a grid, find the minimum connections to join these. The statement seems a bit complex, but this is just a simple BFS.\r\n            - We had 15 mins still, so the interviewer gave another problem. Given a grid which contains 1 and 0, find the number of distinct shapes. ---- [ **Strong Hire** ]\r\n            [1,0,0,0,1,1]\r\n            [1,1,0,0,0,1]\r\n            [0,0,0,0,1,0]\r\n            [0,0,0,0,1,1]\r\n            This returns 2. The first distinct shape is top left representing an 'L' and another is an inverted 'L' on top right.   \r\n    -   System Design\r\n        - 2 Behavioral questions  \r\n        - Design a ride sharing app like Uber. Though the question was straightforward, the interviewer expected far more depth. Looking back, I think I was not able to communicate properly. There was not a lot of conviction in my answers. Extremely disappointed that I messed this up :(  ----     [ **No / Weak Hire for L6-2** ] \r\n\r\nThe recruiter mentioned the feedback was mixed and they wanted to take a follow up on System Design. He also mentioned that the Weak Hire on Coding was also a red flag. I guess, if you are unlucky and if you get an interviewer who is not so experienced and does not know what to focus on to get signals in an interview, this could happen.\r\n\r\nFollow up System Design\r\n- 2 Behavioral questions\r\n- Design a blob storage like S3. I hadn't looked at such a problem before, so it was challenging but the interviewer was nice. He was course-correcting me whenever I was taking a wrong path. It was indeed a collaboration. We discussed a lot about DynamoDb, how does replication work, how does partioning work in DynamoDb etc. But overall, I did not meet the Staff bar. ----- [ **Strong Hire for L6-1** ]\r\n\r\nThe recruiter reaches out after half hr with a confirmation if I was ok to relocate to Seattle. Once I gave an approval , he gave me a verbal offer.\r\n\r\nJust before our call to discuss the offer Recruiter mentions Coupang has paused all offers which require H1 transfer due to Govt Shutdown and uncertainty around 100K fee. This was unfortunate I did not receive the written offer letter. The numbers were very good for Seattle!\r\n\r\nOverall, the recruiter was nice to work with. The interviewers were nice to chat with. The last thing left a sour taste in my mouth since no other company I interviewed with mentioned this, so it is hard to believe why Coupang is doing this. Maybe there is some other reason the recruiter does not want to share.\r\n\r\nPreparation Post: [https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7368458/coupang-intuit-salesforce-oracle-c3ai-se-n0gq/](https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7368458/coupang-intuit-salesforce-oracle-c3ai-se-n0gq/)\r\n"}

They may present you with an offer that looks slightly better than your current options\u2014sometimes even more attractive than offers from product-based companies\u2014but the day you join is the day things start going downhill. Keep the following points in mind:\n\n1. **Misalignment Between Interview and Final Role**\n   After completing interviews for a role such as Lead Engineer, they may later claim your performance wasn\u2019t strong enough and downgrade the position to Senior Software Engineer. They often reassure candidates with promises of a promotion within six months. Do not fall for this\u2014I\u2019ve seen many people join under this expectation and never receive the promotion.\n\n2. **Delayed Salary Increments**\n   Even if you proceed, when appraisal time comes, they tend to use excuses like market slowdowns or upcoming recessions to postpone salary hikes\u2014sometimes by three to six months.\n\n3. **Extremely Low Hikes**\n   If you do receive a hike, it\u2019s shockingly low\u2014typically around 2\u20134%, at best 5%. Don\u2019t trust any claims from EPAM HR about generous increments; this pattern is consistent across the company.\n\n4. **Underwhelming Promotion Benefits**\n   Even when you work hard, aim for an internal promotion, prepare for months, and clear the assessment successfully, the promised \u201cbig hike\u201d rarely materializes. When the updated compensation finally arrives it turns out to be disappointingly small, nowhere near what was suggested.\n\nNever join Epam!\n"}

He also focused on how APIs will look and some discussions around scaling etc was also made\n\n\nOverall the final verdict was that i was selected but with a **downlevel to a SDE-2** role. The main reason given was my overall experience was lower than most SDE-3s in the org ( they wanted > 6 years) also my performance in 2nd round specifically was considered not meeting the SDE-3 bar.\n\nI had to decline the offer because of this.

Many of us struggle with DSA and feel overwhelmed during interview preparation. This might be because we try to solve every problem differently instead of recognizing patterns. However, if you break down DSA into clear patterns and master each one, interviews become much more manageable. So I've compiled the complete list of patterns you absolutely need to know!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 1: Sliding Window\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nSliding window is one of the most frequently tested patterns in interviews. It optimizes brute force O(n\u00b2) solutions to O(n) by maintaining a window of elements and sliding it across the array/string. This pattern appears in substring problems, subarray problems, and anywhere you need to track a contiguous sequence.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Finding longest/shortest substring with condition\r\n- Subarray with target sum/property\r\n- Maximum/minimum in subarrays of size K\r\n- Problems with \"contiguous\" elements\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Fixed window: Move right, slide left when window size exceeds K\r\n- Variable window: Expand right, shrink left when condition violated\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)\r\n2. [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)\r\n3.

[Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)\r\n8. [Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 2: Prefix Sum\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nPrefix sum is a preprocessing technique that allows you to calculate range sums in O(1) time. It's crucial for subarray sum problems and appears in many optimization scenarios. This pattern is often combined with hash maps for powerful solutions to sum-related problems.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Subarray sum equals K\r\n- Range sum queries\r\n- Finding subarrays with specific properties\r\n- 2D matrix sum queries\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n```\r\nprefixSum[i] = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i]\r\nsum(i, j) = prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i-1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)\r\n2. [Contiguous Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-array/)\r\n3.

[Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sums-divisible-by-k/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 3: Two Pointers\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nTwo pointers is your go-to technique for array/string problems that require comparing or processing elements from different positions. It reduces time complexity from O(n\u00b2) to O(n) in many cases. This is one of the most versatile patterns - works on sorted arrays, palindromes, and partitioning problems.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Sorted array problems\r\n- Palindrome checking\r\n- Pair/triplet sum problems\r\n- Removing duplicates\r\n- Partitioning arrays\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Opposite direction: Start from both ends, move toward center\r\n- Same direction: Both pointers move forward at different speeds\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Two Sum II - Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)\r\n2. [3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)\r\n3. [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)\r\n4. [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/)\r\n5. [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)\r\n6. [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)\r\n7. [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Pattern 4: Fast & Slow Pointers\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nFast and slow pointers (tortoise and hare) is an elegant technique for detecting cycles and finding middle elements in linked lists. It uses O(1) space where naive approaches need O(n). This pattern is a favorite in interviews because it tests your understanding of pointer manipulation.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Cycle detection in linked lists\r\n- Finding middle of linked list\r\n- Finding cycle start point\r\n- Happy number problems\r\n- Palindrome linked list\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Slow moves 1 step, fast moves 2 steps\r\n- If cycle exists, they'll meet\r\n- After meeting, reset one to head to find cycle start\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)\r\n2. [Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)\r\n3. [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)\r\n4. [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)\r\n5. [Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-linked-list/)\r\n6. [Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 5: LinkedList In-place Reversal\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nReversing linked lists in-place is a fundamental skill that appears frequently in interviews. It requires careful pointer manipulation and tests your understanding of linked list structure. Once you master the basic reversal, variations become straightforward.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Reverse entire linked list\r\n- Reverse part of linked list\r\n- Reverse in groups of K\r\n- Reorder linked list\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n```java\r\nprev = null, curr = head\r\nwhile (curr != null) {\r\n    next = curr.next\r\n    curr.next = prev\r\n    prev = curr\r\n    curr = next\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)\r\n2. [Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)\r\n3. [Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)\r\n4. [Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)\r\n5. [Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)\r\n6. [Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 6: Monotonic Stack\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nMonotonic stack maintains elements in increasing or decreasing order, allowing you to find next/previous greater/smaller elements efficiently. This pattern transforms O(n\u00b2) brute force solutions into O(n). It's particularly elegant once you understand when to push and when to pop.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Next greater/smaller element\r\n- Previous greater/smaller element\r\n- Histogram problems\r\n- Temperature problems\r\n- Stock span problems\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Increasing stack: Pop when current > stack.top()\r\n- Decreasing stack: Pop when current < stack.top()\r\n- Store indices rather than values for more info\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/)\r\n2. [Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)\r\n3. [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)\r\n4. [Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)\r\n5. [Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)\r\n6. [Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/)\r\n7. [Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-subarray-minimums/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 7: Top K Elements\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nFinding top K elements is extremely common in real-world applications and interviews. Using a heap of size K gives O(n log k) complexity, which is much better than sorting O(n log n) when K is small. This pattern appears in recommendation systems, analytics, and optimization problems.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- K largest/smallest elements\r\n- K most frequent elements\r\n- K closest points\r\n- Median finding\r\n- Merging K sorted lists\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- K largest \u2192 Use min heap of size K\r\n- K smallest \u2192 Use max heap of size K\r\n- Maintain heap size = K, replace root if better element found\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)\r\n2. [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)\r\n3. [K Closest Points to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)\r\n4. [Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)\r\n5. [Merge K Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)\r\n6. [Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 8: Overlapping Intervals (Merge Intervals)\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nInterval problems are ubiquitous in scheduling, calendar, and resource allocation scenarios. The key insight is to sort intervals first, then merge/process in a single pass. This pattern appears in meeting rooms, flight bookings, and timeline problems.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Merging intervals\r\n- Finding overlapping intervals\r\n- Interval insertion\r\n- Meeting room problems\r\n- Scheduling conflicts\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n1. Sort intervals by start time\r\n2. Iterate and check if current overlaps with previous\r\n3. Merge or count as needed\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)\r\n2. [Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)\r\n3. [Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)\r\n4. [Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)\r\n5. [Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)\r\n6. [Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/)\r\n7. [Car Pooling](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 9: Modified Binary Search\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nBinary search isn't just for finding elements in sorted arrays. Modified binary search applies the same principle to rotated arrays, search space reduction, and optimization problems. Recognizing when a problem can use binary search on the \"answer space\" is a key skill.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Rotated sorted arrays\r\n- Peak finding\r\n- Search in 2D matrix\r\n- Finding square root\r\n- Capacity optimization problems\r\n- \"Minimum/maximum value such that...\"\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Identify monotonic property\r\n- Binary search on answer space\r\n- Check feasibility in O(n) or less\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)\r\n2. [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)\r\n3. [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)\r\n4. [Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)\r\n5. [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)\r\n6. [Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://leetcode.com/problems/capacity-to-ship-packages-within-d-days/)\r\n7. [Koko Eating Bananas](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 10: Binary Tree Traversal\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nTree traversal is fundamental to all tree problems. Understanding the three main traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder) and level-order traversal is essential. Each traversal has specific use cases - inorder for BST, preorder for copying, postorder for deletion, level-order for shortest path.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Process all nodes in specific order\r\n- Inorder: BST sorted order, validation\r\n- Preorder: Tree serialization, copying\r\n- Postorder: Tree deletion, dependency resolution\r\n- Level-order: Shortest path, level-wise processing\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- DFS: Recursion or stack (inorder, preorder, postorder)\r\n- BFS: Queue (level-order)\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/)\r\n2. [Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/)\r\n3. [Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/)\r\n4. [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)\r\n5. [Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-zigzag-level-order-traversal/)\r\n6. [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 11: Depth-First Search (DFS)\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nDFS explores as deep as possible before backtracking. It's your go-to for tree problems, graph cycle detection, path finding, and exploring all possibilities. DFS is particularly elegant with recursion and forms the basis for backtracking problems.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Tree depth/height problems\r\n- Path sum problems\r\n- Cycle detection\r\n- Connected components\r\n- Topological sort\r\n- Graph coloring\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Mark visited\r\n- Process current node\r\n- Recursively visit neighbors\r\n- Unmark if backtracking needed\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)\r\n2. [Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)\r\n3.

[Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 12: Breadth-First Search (BFS)\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nBFS explores level by level, guaranteeing shortest path in unweighted graphs. It's essential for level-order problems, shortest path problems, and minimum step problems. The queue-based implementation is intuitive and appears in many real-world scenarios like social networks and maze solving.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Shortest path in unweighted graph\r\n- Level-order traversal\r\n- Minimum steps/moves problems\r\n- Connected components\r\n- \"Nearest\" problems\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Use queue\r\n- Add start node(s)\r\n- Process level by level\r\n- Track visited to avoid cycles\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1.

[Shortest Path in Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)\r\n6. [As Far from Land as Possible](https://leetcode.com/problems/as-far-from-land-as-possible/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 13: Matrix Traversal\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nMatrix problems are just graph problems in disguise - each cell is a node, and adjacent cells are neighbors. Once you see this connection, grid problems become straightforward graph traversal. This pattern is extremely common in interviews and tests your ability to handle 2D arrays and boundary conditions.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Island problems\r\n- Flood fill\r\n- Path finding in grid\r\n- Region identification\r\n- Any 2D grid problem\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n- Treat as graph with 4 or 8 neighbors\r\n- DFS or BFS from each unvisited cell\r\n- Watch for boundaries\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1. [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)\r\n2. [Max Area of Island](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/)\r\n3. [Surrounded Regions](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)\r\n4. [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)\r\n5. [Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)\r\n6. [Shortest Path in Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-path-in-binary-matrix/)\r\n7. [Number of Closed Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-closed-islands/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Pattern 14: Backtracking\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nBacktracking explores all possible solutions by making choices, exploring consequences, and undoing choices if they don't work. It's essential for permutations, combinations, subsets, and constraint satisfaction problems. While potentially exponential, it's often the only way to solve certain problems.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Generate all permutations/combinations\r\n- Subset problems\r\n- Sudoku, N-Queens\r\n- String partitioning\r\n- Path finding with constraints\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n1. Make a choice\r\n2. Explore with that choice (recurse)\r\n3. Undo the choice (backtrack)\r\n4. Try next choice\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1.

[Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##  Pattern 15: Dynamic Programming\r\n\r\n**Why This Pattern Matters:**\r\nDP is the most feared but most rewarding pattern. It optimizes recursive solutions by storing results of subproblems. While there are many DP patterns (1D, 2D, LIS, LCS, knapsack), the key is recognizing overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure. Master the mindset, not just individual problems.\r\n\r\n**When to Use:**\r\n- Optimization problems (max/min)\r\n- Counting problems\r\n- Decision making problems\r\n- Problems with overlapping subproblems\r\n- Keywords: \"maximum\", \"minimum\", \"longest\", \"count ways\"\r\n\r\n**Key Technique:**\r\n1. Identify state variables\r\n2. Write recurrence relation\r\n3. Identify base cases\r\n4. Memoize or build bottom-up\r\n\r\n**Practice Problems:**\r\n1.

After about a week, I received a shortlisting mail containing details about the position, location, and stipend.\r\n\r\nThe hiring process consisted of three rounds:\r\n\r\nResume Shortlisting\r\n\r\nOnline Assessment\r\n\r\nInterview\r\n\r\nRound 1: Online Assessment\r\n\r\nAlong with the shortlisting mail, I received an invite for the Online Assessment (OA), which had a duration of 1 hour 30 minutes.\r\nI found this OA quite unique \u2014 it had around 6\u20138 modules comprising:\r\n\r\nPython-related questions\r\n\r\nSQL questions\r\n\r\nSimple math and aptitude questions\r\n\r\nEnglish grammar\r\n\r\nAnd some memory-based tasks (for example, a 3\u00d73 block showing numbers that had to be memorized and later arranged in ascending and descending order).\r\n\r\nI completed this round in about 70 minutes.\r\n\r\nRound 2: Technical Interview\r\n\r\nThe next day, I received a mail stating that I had cleared the OA and was selected for the interview round. I scheduled my interview for 06-11-25, and to my surprise, the duration mentioned was only 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nI reached out to a few current interns to get an idea of the interview process. They mentioned that the questions were mostly based on SQL, Python, and some basic coding problems like:\r\n\r\nFibonacci number\r\n\r\nReverse a linked list\r\n\r\nFind the maximum and second maximum in an array\r\n\r\nSo, I felt confident that I could clear this round since it was supposed to last only 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nInterview Experience\r\n\r\nOn the interview day, the interviewer began with his introduction and gave a brief overview of the company. After that, I introduced myself.\r\n\r\nHe started with OOPs concepts \u2014 asking about the four pillars of OOPs, the difference between overriding and overloading, abstract classes, interfaces, and the difference between them. I answered all of them with proper examples.\r\n\r\nThen he moved on to SQL questions, which included:\r\n\r\nGROUP BY\r\n\r\nDifferent types of JOINs (in detail)\r\n\r\nDifference between HAVING and WHERE\r\n\r\nIndexing\r\n\r\nNormalization\r\n\r\nHe also gave me a table and asked me to perform a few SQL operations on it.\r\nBy this time, more than 30 minutes had passed, and I was happy that I had answered everything well \u2014 assuming the interview was about to end.\r\nHowever, the interview stretched to almost 2 hours \ud83d\ude05.\r\n\r\nDSA Questions\r\n\r\nHe then moved to Data Structures and Algorithms, where he asked one easy and three medium-level problems:\r\n\r\nLongest Consecutive Sequence\r\n\r\nReverse Words in a String\r\n\r\nValid Anagram\r\n\r\nA variation of \u201cMove Zeroes to End\u201d (I couldn\u2019t find the exact question on LeetCode, but it was slightly different from the standard one).\r\n\r\nProject & Miscellaneous Questions\r\n\r\nAfter that, he asked a few questions related to my projects.\r\nBy this time, I was mentally drained, and I couldn\u2019t answer some questions properly. Also, I had mentioned in one of my projects that I \u201coptimized it by 20%\u201d and had \u201c50+ active users\u201d \u2014 which I had added just to improve my ATS score \ud83d\ude05. Unfortunately, that left a negative impression.\r\n\r\nThere were also a few Java-related questions, such as the difference between JDK and JRE, and one more OOPs-based question, which I couldn\u2019t answer correctly."}

Both focused on my resume, design principles, and behavioral aspects.\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Final Onsite Discussion \u2013 with a local manager, focusing on team fit, culture, and leadership aspects.\n\nThe offered range discussed was \u20b919 LPA base + bonus \u2014 quite aligned with my expectations.\n\nHere\u2019s where the story takes a turn.\n\nBefore even completing my final rounds, the HR informed me that they were starting my background verification (BGV) process.\nHe clearly mentioned that it would only stop if something went wrong in the final round.\nThis made me feel confident that things were going well.\n\nAfter the final round, I was asked to upload both sides of my Aadhaar card (I had initially uploaded only the front).\nThat communication came after the last interview \u2014 which to me, clearly meant I had cleared all rounds.\n\nThen\u2026 silence.\n\nI followed up multiple times \u2014 politely, professionally \u2014 and after several days, the HR finally replied that \u201cthe position is currently on hold, and we can\u2019t proceed with your profile right now.\u201d\n\nThat was it. No feedback, no closure, no proper communication \u2014 just a door closed quietly after weeks of effort and hope.\n\nIt hurts, honestly.\nNot just because of the outcome, but because of how it was handled.\nThroughout the process, there was consistent communication \u2014 until suddenly, there wasn\u2019t.\n\nI totally understand when companies have internal changes or hiring freezes \u2014 that\u2019s normal.\nBut as candidates, we deserve transparency, closure, and respect for the time we invest.\n\nI spent weeks preparing, giving rounds across time zones, interacting with teams from different countries \u2014 and then everything just vanished in a \u201cposition on hold\u201d email.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because this isn\u2019t just about me \u2014 it\u2019s something that happens to so many candidates silently.\nLet\u2019s normalize talking about it.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the same boat \u2014 waiting endlessly after giving your best \u2014 please remember, your worth is not defined by a company\u2019s silence.\n\n#Guidewire #InterviewExperience #Transparency #HiringPractices #CandidateExperience #SoftwareEngineering #LowBalling #RespectCandidates #CareerJourney #TechInterviews #HonestHiring #JobSearch #EmotionalPost"}

The HR even confirmed multiple times that I was selected and said they\u2019d be offering 15\u201316 LPA (my current is 13 LPA, and I had mentioned an expectation of around 19 base).\nI was okay with 15\u201316 and felt happy that all my effort was paying off.\n\nThen the waiting started.\nDays turned into weeks. I kept following up, and every time the HR said the offer was \u201cunder approval.\u201d\n\nFinally, after several follow-ups, she called back \u2014 and suddenly said the budget had changed, and they could only offer 9 + 1 LPA.\nThat\u2019s way below my current salary.\n\nIt honestly broke my heart.\nNot because of the number, but because of how things were handled.\nI spent hours preparing, giving 5 rounds, getting told I was selected \u2014 and then, in the end, this.\n\nI completely understand that companies have budget constraints, but transparency matters.\nIf compensation is a concern, it should be discussed upfront \u2014 not after the candidate has invested weeks of time and hope.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see how often this happens now.\nWe, as candidates, prepare sincerely, juggle our current work, and still give our best \u2014 and all we expect is fairness and honesty in return.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this not out of anger, but disappointment.\nBecause every time this happens, it quietly chips away at someone\u2019s confidence.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone through something similar, you\u2019re not alone.\nLet\u2019s keep supporting each other and keep pushing for more respectful hiring practices.\n\n#InterviewExperience #Vymo #Transparency #Lowballing #JobSearch #RespectCandidates"}

I have 2.5 Years of experience. Would appreciate some honest takes from folks who\u2019ve been in similar situations.\n\nOption 1: AI Startup (early-stage)\n\nAround 30 people, expanding, moderate revenue per employee.\nMostly remote with a few hybrid days. Work hours can be spread throughout the day.\nSmaller team but quality people (mostly from Top indian colleges etc.), though I\u2019d be among the most junior.\nHigh ownership, more responsibility, and a steep learning curve.\nDirect access to founders and leadership, more visibility.\nExposure to analytics and AI domain \u2014 good for future scope if AI continues to grow.\nRisk is higher: if funding slows down, the company could shut down easily.\nExperience may or may not hold value later depending on how the company performs.\nHarder to get into AI startups in the future if domain expertise becomes a requirement.\nUnclear long-term stability.\n\nOption 2: Walmart (SDE III, Bangalore)\n\nLarge, well-established company with over 10k+ employees.\nStable, though global layoffs can happen during downturns.\nEasier long-term brand recognition; MNCs tend to value Walmart profiles.\nExposure to large-scale distributed systems and complex architecture.\nEasier to switch from MNC \u2192 startup later, but not the other way around.\nSlower learning curve compared to a startup; work might be repetitive.\nLess ownership and direct visibility due to multiple levels of hierarchy.\nMore people to interact with \u2014 good exposure to corporate culture and management practices.\nContinuation in the e-commerce space; could build a strong career pattern there.\n\n\nIn short:\n\nAI startup: High risk, fast growth, ownership, AI + analytics exposure.\nWalmart: Stability, brand value, structured environment, large-scale systems.\n\nI\u2019m trying to decide whether to bet on the AI domain early, or go with a safer, brand-backed MNC path and switch to AI later if needed.\n\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and reasoning!!!"}

Create system to track what songs were played, how many times was each song played, most played songs in total, and per user recent 3 songs. Was easy in my opinion.\n\n##### Round 2 System Design\nMake a temperory email service which lets users create a mail account and receive mails for 5 hours. It should purge mails after that and handle high loads and maintain anonimity. Was challenging but loved the interview. He dug deep into all my design choices. What encryption I'm using, how I'm generating random mails, how I'm storing mails, where I'm storing attachments, etc \n\n##### Round 3 Coding\nAnother LLD style question similar to Round 1. It was related to Movie Booking. Exact question don't remember. But was easy for me.\n\n### Questions?\n1. I've talked to people and confirmed (also heard) Rippling WLB is pretty bad. 12 hours shifts are normal. What have you guys heard?\n2. Also, the tech stack is Python / Django and HM himself mentioned that tech wise they are meh but you'll learn a lot about busines. Is it worth joining if I don't grow technically?\n3. Also, learning about tax, payroll, HR etc doesn't excite me. That's what Rippling is about. \n\nAny suggestions if you think it's worth joining? I'm leaning No but would love your inputs."}

A retailer at (a, b) can serve to all points lying within the rectangle formed by the point (a,b) with both the axes.

One of them was, if we could flatten the tree into a list with all children to the left. He told me that, while it is indeed a solution, we are looking for something that resembles a binary tree more.\r\n\r\nQuestion 2 : Given an array of product ids, you had to return the minimum length of a subarray that contains at least k distinct elements, along with the starting and ending index.\r\n\r\nI was asked the TC and SC of both solutions.\r\n\r\nFollow up questions included use cases of a BST in real life, some time complexities, indexing in SQL, etc.\r\n\r\nWe concluded the round with a few questions from my side and best wishes from the interviewer :)\r\n\r\nI had also asked some other people, and most of them were asked the \"Search in rotated sorted array\", \"Minimum coins\" problems.

I graduated in 2024 with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering and have been working for the past 10 months as a NOC(Network Operations & Cloud) Engineer at a US-based product company.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what my day-to-day work involves:-\r\n- Monitoring dashboards, identifying SEVs, logging and managing tickets\r\n- Basic troubleshooting on the infrastructure side\r\n- Low-level OS patching\r\n- Working with AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes during deployments\r\n- Writing Python scripts for automation\r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019ve gained some exposure to cloud and infrastructure, most of the work feels repetitive and operational. I feel like I\u2019m not growing as an engineer and that this role is holding me back from my real interests.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s my technical background:\r\n\r\n- Strong data structures and algorithms skills with over 900 problems solved and a 1750 rating.\r\n- Built and deployed full-stack projects using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, React, Docker, AWS and Angular\r\n- Developed Good machine learning projects during weekends\r\n- Earned AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and currently working towards AWS Solutions Architect certification\r\n- Also certified in OCI DevOps\r\n\r\nDuring my final year placements, I interviewed for Software Engineer roles at companies like Amazon, Uber, Salesforce, and Informatica but unfortunately didn\u2019t clear the final rounds\r\n\r\nI genuinely dislike my current role in NOC as it feels like I\u2019m not utilizing my skills and potential. I really want to transition into a Software Engineer role.\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is it realistically possible to move from NOC to SWE or atleast SRE after about a year of Support experience?\r\n2. What should I prioritize to make this switch like personal projects, certifications, open-source contributions, or focused interview preparation?\r\n3. Should I first try to move internally to a development or SRE team in my current company, or start applying externally right away?\r\n4. How can I present my NOC experience on my resume so that it supports my application for SWE or SRE roles rather than holding me back?\r\n\r\nAny advice or personal experiences from others who have made a similar transition would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."}

Because of the laggy interface, most of the time went into handling the platform rather than optimizing the code.\n\n- There were also some MCQs, but I could attempt only a few due to time constraints.\n\n*\ud83e\udde0 Tip: Focus on easy to easy\u2013medium level DSA questions and get comfortable with JUnit test cases. Time management is key since the platform can be slow.*\n\n---\n\n\n**Round 2: Technical Interview**\n\n- This round mainly focused on Java 8 and advanced Java concepts.\n\n- The interviewer gave one coding problem and asked me to solve it strictly using Java 8 features (Streams, Lambdas, Optionals, etc.).\n\n- The problem itself was not hard, but they wanted to see how effectively I could apply modern Java concepts.\n\n- A few additional questions came from Multithreading and Spring Boot basics.\n\n*\ud83e\udde9 Tip: Revise Streams API, Functional Interfaces, Collectors, and core Spring Boot annotations. They focus more on your coding approach than just the final output.*\n\n---\n\n**Round 3: Techno-Managerial Interview (Approx. 1.5 Hours)**\n\n> This was the most detailed round of the entire process, and during this round, I got to know that the position was actually for Goldman Sachs as the client.\n\n**First Half (Technical):**\n\n- Deep dive into Spring Boot, Microservices, REST APIs, API Gateway, Deployment process, and CI/CD pipelines.\n\n- Questions were scenario-based and tested how I would approach real-world issues like service failures, scalability, and versioning.\n\n**Second Half (Managerial):**\n\n- Detailed discussion on my current project, roles and responsibilities, and features I delivered.\n\n- I was asked about story points assigned in the last sprint and how much I delivered on time.\n\n- The focus was on accountability, communication, and ownership of work.\n\n*\ud83e\udde0 Tip: Have a strong understanding of your project especially architecture, deployment flow, and your personal contributions.*\n\n---\n\n**Round 4: HR Discussion (Approx. 30 Minutes)**\n\n> This was a very calm and straightforward discussion.\n\n- Covered salary expectations, family background, and preferred work mode.\n\n- We also talked about benefits and allowances, make sure you ask clearly about:\n\n  - Joining bonus\n\n  - Relocation allowance\n\n  - Temporary stay/accommodation support\n\n*\ud83d\udca1 Tip: If you are expecting a 150%+ hike, prepare a clear justification for it, like your technical expertise, project ownership, or market standards.*\n\n---\n\n\n"}

It\u2019s been a mix of emotions  the excitement of solving a problem, the frustration of getting stuck for hours, and the confusion of not always knowing where to begin.\r\n\r\nI know I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s felt this way, so I wanted to start a discussion where both beginners and experienced coders can share what really helped them at the start of their journey. Whether it\u2019s your daily routine, mindset, or specific resources, every bit of advice helps.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1. If You Could Give One Piece of Advice to Someone Just Starting Out, What Would It Be?\r\n\r\nWhen you first began solving problems on LeetCode:  \r\n\r\n- How did you overcome that initial feeling of not knowing where to start?  \r\n- What\u2019s your strategy when you\u2019re stuck on a question for a long time? Do you check hints, read discussions, or revisit it later?  \r\n- How many problems per week do you think is a good target for beginners?  \r\n- Is there a recommended topic order to follow  for example, starting with Arrays and Strings before moving on to Two Pointers, Sliding Window, or Dynamic Programming?  \r\n- Do you focus more on deeply understanding concepts (quality) or solving as many problems as possible (quantity)? How do you balance the two?  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2. Best Free Resources for Absolute Beginners\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love to know what resources helped you the most when you were just starting out:  \r\n\r\n- Any YouTube channels that explain problems in a beginner-friendly way?  \r\n- Blogs or websites that helped you understand patterns or data structures better?  \r\n- Any books or free courses that made key concepts finally click?  \r\n\r\nSometimes, even a single video or blog post can completely change how you approach problem-solving, so your suggestions could help a lot of people  including me.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n## 3. Your Biggest \u201cAha!\u201d Moment\r\n\r\nFor those who have been solving problems for a while  was there a particular concept, technique, or problem that made everything start to make sense?  \r\nMaybe something that helped you go from *\u201cI\u2019m lost\u201d* to *\u201cI get it now.\u201d*  \r\n\r\nHearing about those moments can be really motivating for beginners who might be struggling right now.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 4. Questions from Beginners\r\n\r\nAlso, if you\u2019re a beginner and have any questions, feel free to ask them here.  \r\nNo question is too small. Let\u2019s make this thread a space where we can all learn, help each other, and grow together as problem solvers.  \r\n"}

Like many others, I had big dreams but an unclear path. I gave 2 attempts at UPSC, even reached the **Mains stage in my first attempt**, but couldn\u2019t make it further. By **mid-2023, I decided to switch to the IT field** \u2014 with absolutely zero background in coding or development.\r\n\r\nI started with DSA from scratch. No shortcuts \u2014 just LeetCode, mentorship from college seniors, YouTube, and endless doubts. But reality hit hard \u2014 MNCs weren\u2019t shortlisting me, and startups rejected me for having no dev experience. Every rejection chipped away at my confidence. I went through severe self-doubt and depression.\r\n\r\nIn **January 2024,** after hundreds of applications, I finally landed a small role earning **\u20b910,000 per month**. It wasn\u2019t glamorous, but it was a start \u2014 and that\u2019s what mattered the most at that time.\r\n\r\n**Three months later,** I got a remote opportunity at an Australian startup with a **\u20b940,000 stipend**. That moment gave me a glimpse of hope \u2014 proof that my efforts were finally paying off. I took a short break afterward to recharge and refocus.\r\n\r\nBy November 2024, I started applying again \u2014 and this time, things were different. My skills had grown, my projects were better, and I had real confidence. I started getting calls from MNCs and top startups that once ignored me.\r\n\r\nFinally, after multiple rejections and almost 10 months of continuous effort, in **September 2025** I cracked an offer for **\u20b919 LPA CTC(17 base) at a Bangalore-based B2B SaaS startup.**\r\n\r\n**From \u20b91.2 lack per annum to \u20b91.25 lakh per month \u2014 that\u2019s been my 1 year 9 month journey into IT sector.**\r\n\r\nWas it luck? Maybe. I do believe God has been kind, but more importantly, it was patience, pain, and persistence that made it possible.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who\u2019s struggling right now \u2014 don\u2019t lose hope. Keep learning, keep building, and most importantly \u2014 keep believing.\r\n\r\nPlease share this with your friends who are preparing for UPSC.\r\nLife is much bigger than a single exam \u2014 it always gives you more chances to prove yourself.\r\nAll you need to do is never let your hope die down. \ud83c\udf3b \r\n\r\nI\u2019ll be taking another short break now, and this time, my focus is  to get into FAANG SDE2. Hoping to make it happen in 2026.\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n#career, #motivation, #leetcode, #journey, #Faang, #grind, #DSA"}

The compensation details in my offer align with an SDE-II role, but the title everywhere is written simply as Software Development Engineer. Is this normal, or should I bring it up with my recruiter and ask for clarification or a correction?\n- I also have few questions about the team and role along with the current environment inside Amazon regarding layoffs.

I graduated in 2024 with a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering and have been working for the past 10 months as a NOC(Network Operations & Cloud) Engineer at a US-based product company.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what my day-to-day work involves:-\r\n- Monitoring dashboards, identifying SEVs, logging and managing tickets\r\n- Basic troubleshooting on the infrastructure side\r\n- Low-level OS patching\r\n- Working with AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes during deployments\r\n- Writing Python scripts for automation\r\n\r\nWhile I\u2019ve gained some exposure to cloud and infrastructure, most of the work feels repetitive and operational. I feel like I\u2019m not growing as an engineer and that this role is holding me back from my real interests.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s my technical background:\r\n\r\n- Strong data structures and algorithms skills with over 900 problems solved and a 1750 rating.\r\n- Built and deployed full-stack projects using Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate, React, AWS and Angular\r\n- Developed Good machine learning projects during weekends\r\n- Earned AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and currently working towards AWS Solutions Architect certification\r\n- Also certified in OCI DevOps\r\n\r\nDuring my final year placements, I interviewed for Software Engineer roles at companies like Amazon, Uber, Salesforce, and Informatica but unfortunately didn\u2019t clear the final rounds\r\n\r\nI genuinely dislike my current role in NOC as it feels like I\u2019m not utilizing my skills and potential. I really want to transition into a Software Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer role.\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is it realistically possible to move from NOC to SWE or SRE after about a year of NOC experience?\r\n2. What should I prioritize to make this switch like personal projects, certifications, open-source contributions, or focused interview preparation?\r\n3. Should I first try to move internally to a development or SRE team in my current company, or start applying externally right away?\r\n4. How can I present my NOC experience on my resume so that it supports my application for SWE or SRE roles rather than holding me back?\r\n\r\nAny advice or personal experiences from others who have made a similar transition would be really helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."}

Each man has a ranked preference list of all n women, and each woman has a ranked preference list of all n men. The goal is to find a stable matching, which is a pairing of all n men and n women such that no two people would prefer to be with each other over their current partners.\r\n\r\nA pair (m,w) is considered unstable if:\r\n\r\nm prefers some other woman w\u2032 over his current partner w.\r\n\r\nw\u2032 also prefers m over her current partner.\r\n\r\nYour task is to implement an algorithm that finds a stable matching for any given set of preferences.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nLet n=2.\r\nMen: M_1,M_2\r\nWomen: W_1,W_2\r\n\r\nPreferences:\r\n\r\nM_1: W_1, W_2\r\n\r\nM_2: W_2, W_1\r\n\r\nW_1: M_2, M_1\r\n\r\nW_2: M_1, M_2\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n\r\nmen_preferences = {\r\n    \"M1\": [\"W1\", \"W2\"],\r\n    \"M2\": [\"W2\", \"W1\"]\r\n}\r\nwomen_preferences = {\r\n    \"W1\": [\"M2\", \"M1\"],\r\n    \"W2\": [\"M1\", \"M2\"]\r\n}\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n[(\"M1\", \"W2\"), (\"M2\", \"W1\")]\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\nM_1 is paired with W_2. Even though he prefers W_1, W_1 prefers her partner M_2 over M_1, so no instability exists.\r\n\r\nM_2 is paired with W_1. He prefers her to his other option, and she prefers him to her other option. This is a stable pair.\r\n\r\nConstraints:\r\n\r\n1\u2264n\u226450\r\n\r\nAll preference lists are complete and unique.\r\n\r\nGeneral Solution for n x n: The Gale-Shapley Algorithm\r\nThe most common and effective solution for the stable marriage problem is the Gale-Shapley algorithm. It guarantees a stable matching in polynomial time (O(n2)).\r\n\r\nAlgorithm Steps:\r\nInitialization: All men and women are considered free.\r\n\r\nProposals: The algorithm proceeds in rounds. In each round, every free man proposes to the most-preferred woman on his list to whom he has not yet proposed.\r\n\r\nResponses:\r\n\r\nIf a woman receives a proposal from a man she is currently free, she accepts and becomes engaged to him.\r\n\r\nIf a woman is already engaged but receives a proposal from a man she prefers over her current fianc\u00e9, she accepts the new proposal and jilts her current fianc\u00e9. The jilted man becomes free again.\r\n\r\nIf a woman receives a proposal from a man she considers less desirable than her current fianc\u00e9, she rejects his proposal.\r\n\r\nTermination: This process continues until every man is engaged. The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate because in each step, at least one man proposes to a woman he has not yet proposed to, and no man ever proposes to the same woman twice. The final set of engaged pairs is a stable matching.\r\n\r\nWhy it Works:\r\nThe algorithm is \"male-optimal\" because it guarantees that every man gets the best possible partner he could get in any stable matching. This is because men propose in order of preference. If a man gets rejected by a woman, he knows it's because she found someone she prefers more, and he can't do better than his final partner. The reverse is true for women, making the algorithm \"female-pessimal.\" However, a stable matching is always found.\r\n\r\nExample: 3x3 Case with More Input/Output\r\nLet's consider n=3.\r\nMen: M_1,M_2,M_3\r\nWomen: W_1,W_2,W_3\r\n\r\nPreferences:\r\n\r\nM_1: W_1,W_2,W_3\r\n\r\nM_2: W_2,W_1,W_3\r\n\r\nM_3: W_1,W_2,W_3\r\n\r\nW_1: M_2,M_1,M_3\r\n\r\nW_2: M_1,M_2,M_3\r\n\r\nW_3: M_1,M_2,M_3\r\n\r\nStep-by-step execution:\r\n\r\nRound 1:\r\n\r\nM_1 proposes to W_1. W_1 is free, so she accepts. Pair: (M_1,W_1).\r\n\r\nM_2 proposes to W_2. W_2 is free, so she accepts. Pair: (M_2,W_2).\r\n\r\nM_3 proposes to W_1. W_1 is already engaged to M_1. She checks her list: she prefers M_2M_1M_3. She rejects M_3.\r\n\r\nRound 2:\r\n\r\nM_3 is the only free man. He proposes to his next choice, W_2.\r\n\r\nW_2 is engaged to M_2. She checks her list: she prefers M_1M_2M_3. She rejects M_3.\r\n\r\nRound 3:\r\n\r\nM_3 is still free. He proposes to his next choice, W_3.\r\n\r\nW_3 is free. She accepts. Pair: (M_3,W_3).\r\n\r\nAll men are now engaged. The algorithm terminates.\r\n\r\nFinal Output:\r\nThe stable matching is: [(\"M1\", \"W1\"), (\"M2\", \"W2\"), (\"M3\", \"W3\")]\r\n\r\nCode C++ \r\n\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <vector>\r\n#include <string>\r\n#include <map>\r\n#include <list>\r\n\r\n// Function to find a stable matching using the Gale-Shapley algorithm\r\nstd::map<std::string, std::string> stableMatching(\r\n    const std::map<std::string, std::list<std::string>>& men_preferences,\r\n    const std::map<std::string, std::list<std::string>>& women_preferences) {\r\n\r\n    int n = men_preferences.size();\r\n    \r\n    // Tracks men who are currently free\r\n    std::list<std::string> free_men;\r\n    for (const auto& pair : men_preferences) {\r\n        free_men.push_back(pair.first);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Tracks current engagements (woman -> man)\r\n    std::map<std::string, std::string> engagements;\r\n    \r\n    // A mapping from a woman's name to a map of men and their ranks.\r\n    // This allows for O(1) lookup of a man's rank on a woman's preference list.\r\n    std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, int>> women_ranks;\r\n    for (const auto& pair : women_preferences) {\r\n        int rank = 0;\r\n        for (const auto& man : pair.second) {\r\n            women_ranks[pair.first][man] = rank++;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    while (!free_men.empty()) {\r\n        std::string man = free_men.front();\r\n        free_men.pop_front();\r\n\r\n        // Get the first woman on his preference list he hasn't proposed to yet\r\n        std::string woman = men_preferences.at(man).front();\r\n\r\n        // Remove the proposed woman from the man's preference list\r\n        const_cast<std::map<std::string, std::list<std::string>>&>(men_preferences).at(man).pop_front();\r\n\r\n        // If the woman is free, she accepts the proposal\r\n        if (engagements.find(woman) == engagements.end()) {\r\n            engagements[woman] = man;\r\n        } else {\r\n            // Woman is already engaged.

The team consists of 15-20 engineers, including the founders, working from Bangalore and SF.

You are also given an array of indices, `fountains`, which are source points for water. Water flows from these fountains to the left and right, filling any areas lower than the fountain's height until it hits a \"wall\" (a point higher than or equal to the fountain) or the edge of the array. The goal is to determine the final water level across the surface.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n-   `surface = [1, 2, 3, 4]`\r\n-   `fountains = [1, 3]` (Fountains at index 1 (height 2) and index 3 (height 4))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## My Approach & Performance\r\n\r\nHere is a breakdown of my performance during the interview, including timing and thought process.\r\n\r\n### Approach 1: Brute Force\r\n\r\n-   **Explanation (10 mins):** I first described the brute-force solution. For each fountain, simulate the water flow outwards (one pointer to the left, one to the right). Keep track of the maximum water level at each position.\r\n-   **Complexity:**\r\n    -   Time: `O(N * K)` where N is the number of points and K is the number of fountains.\r\n    -   Space: `O(N)` to store the water levels.\r\n-   **Coding (5 mins):** I successfully coded this solution quickly.\r\n\r\n### Approach 2: Optimal (Monotonic Stack)\r\n\r\n-   **Explanation (10 mins for initial dry run):** I identified that the problem could be optimized by pre-calculating the \"next greater element\" to the left and right for each point. This is a classic use case for a **monotonic stack**. My initial attempt to dry-run this approach was shaky and took a significant amount of time.\r\n-   **Reset & Re-explanation (2-3 mins):** I took a moment to reset, then successfully explained the logic more clearly.\r\n-   **Coding (5 mins):** I started coding the optimal logic but ran out of time. I was only able to get about halfway through the implementation.\r\nLike, I coded the logic but did not return the array.\r\n-   **Complexity:**\r\n    -   Time: `O(N)` because the monotonic stack approach processes each element a constant number of times.\r\n    -   Space: `O(N)` for the stack.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Takeaways & Advice for Round 2\r\n\r\nSo, do any of you have feedback for me for Round 2?\r\nAnd what are key things I should improve?\r\n\r\nIs it **hire**/**lean hire**/**strong hire**?

Dynamic Programming\n\n\t- Works when a problem has overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.\n\n\t- Example: Coin Change, Longest Increasing Subsequence.\n\nUsually requires recursion + memoization or tabulation.\n\n2. Greedy Algorithms\n\n\t- Work when locally optimal choices lead to a globally optimal solution.\n\n\t- Example: Activity Selection, Minimum Spanning Tree, Huffman Coding.\n\n\t- Often simpler and faster than DP, but not always correct for all problems.\n\nThe challenge is that many problems look like they can be solved with Greedy, but actually require DP (and vice versa)."}

Expectation was to write production ready code and provide testcases as well. However, I could solve only 1 question before time ran out.\n\nQ: Given a string and a vector of string of random `[start,end]` positions, we need to place bold tags: `<b> at start` and `</b> at end`.\n\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/add-bold-tag-in-string/description/\n\nHandled overlapping intervals by merging them.

Discussed TC and SC.\n\nInterviewer provided no hints/suggestions and was silent throughout.\n\n[Self Verdict: Lean Hire]\n\n**Round 3: Problem Solving** (DSA) (60 minutes)\n\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/description/\n\nDiscussed brute force and optimal approach in detail with interviewer with dry run. Once we both agreed to the solution coded up working solution. Wrote testcases and discussed minor improvements for edge cases. Discussed TC.\n\nQ2: https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number/description/\n\nDiscussed lexicographical approach then interviewer asked to think of several testcases and dry run them. Figured out the problem with my initial approach and discussed optimal approach with merge sort and heap sort. Wrote the recursive call tree for a sample case. Discussed TC and recursive call SC. Coding was not asked for this question.\n\nQ3: Explain BFS and DFS and discuss when to use.\n\nDiscussed the traversal algorithms and data structures for implementation. Discussed about infinite branch problem of DFS. Discussed custom traversal approach based on some heuristic combining BFS and DFS for faster convergence like IDDFS. Also went through real-world use cases of such algorithms like BFS for social network analysis.\n\nOverall had lots of insightful discussion and interviewer was super friendly and helpful. Discussed the impact and use cases of AI for a SWE at Microsoft.\n\n[Self Verdict: Strong Hire]\n\n**Round 4: AA | Hiring Manager** (Behavioural+System Design) (60 minutes)\n\nInterviewer started with asking some behavioural questions regarding why thinking of job change and why Microsoft. Discussed about some areas of interest and past work experience.\n\nQ: Low Level Design of Snake and Ladder Game\nRequirements:\nR1: Board has NxM positions, cannot go beyond boundaries.\nR2: K players each rolling dice in round robin format.\nR3: Implement snakes and ladders. Both cannot be at same position.\nR4: Player needs to roll a 6 to start.\nR5: Rolling a 6 gives second chance to roll dice. \nR6: Three consecutive 6 means chance cancelled.\nR7: If roll is invalid turn goes over to next player.\nR8: Game concludes when any player reaches last position.\n\nImplemented all the requirements. Wrote structured classes, functions and data structures for players, position, board, and gameplay. Discussed some optimizations of time and space and implemented them. Interviewer pointed out some edge cases and made required edits.\n\nHad some time leftover and interviewer was in Copilot team so got a chance to discuss the latest developments of AI and LLM happening inside Microsoft and what might be coming next.\n\n[Self Verdict: Strong Hire]\n\n---\n\n**Final Verdict** \ud83c\udf89\n\nGot verbal offer and document submission mail within 3 working days.

Very easy. I have nothing to write on my resume. In 2 years I have learned nothing technically.\r\n\r\nGoal- I want to get out of this support role. I see people who have nothing to do with CS, doing the same work as me. It suffocates me to see myself like this. \r\n\r\nI have been doing DSA since 2nd year of college (3rd tier college). It's been almost 4-5 years now. I am good at it. \r\n\r\nI never wanted to go in support role since it doesn't have anything very technical and the pay is very very less. In these 2 years I have started and given up on DSA multiple times, started looking for job switch and given up multiple times. \r\n\r\nSometimes, it just hits me I am very very far in this race. There are so many more talented people than me. They have better projects, better college, better experience, better coding profiles, better confidence, better personalities.\r\n\r\nMany people tell me start switching from small company. But very honestly, I don't want to. I have given interviews of small company. I just wanted to run away. Their HRs were absolutely unprofessional. Their office spaces suffocated me. I could already sense people in that office poking their nose in each other bussiness. I don't want to be a part of that culture. (I am extremely sorry if this sounds shallow to read. I mean no offense to anyone. I am just unhappy with myself). \r\n\r\nRight now, the only companies I am eligible for (if I want to switch role) according to my qualification are infosys, TCS. Yes, I don't want to work there. \r\n\r\nI regret not going to a good college. That was the easiest thing I could have done at that time to save my entire life."}

I politely said no, to which she said that she would reach back to me. I waited for 2 days and I did not get any response from her. When I pinged her, she said that we cannot move forward with your profile for SDE - II role, if you are interested in SysDev role, I will schedule the rounds. I again politely said no and moved one.\n\nNow, Fast forward to 5 months, i.e last month, another recruiter reached out to me if I am available for interview next friday. I was confused, and I asked her if I am eligible for this role as the other recruiter said no. \n\nBut, she was like, you are eligible, just let me know your availability. \nI said, I am available and she scheduled 2 rounds - DSA and LLD.\n\n\n**Round 1(DSA):** Started with Leadership principles, which went on for 40 minutes. Then he asked me if we can extend the interview by 10 to 15 mins, to which I said yes. Then he asked me a DSA Question. The question was to find the shortest path between two pieces in a chess board with obstacles. A classic BFS problem!!!\nI gave the BFS approach and he asked me why cant we use DFS. For which, we had a solid discussion around. \n\nThe interviewer had a specific implementation in mind. For example, using a set for visited elements instead of using a boolean array. \n\nI quickly understood what he wanted and adapted to that.\n\n\n**Round 2(LLD):** Again, started with Leadership principles, which went on for 20 minutes. Then came the LLD question - Design a parking lot.\n\nI gathered the requirements and listed the classes with their behaviour and attributes. I also listed the design patterns to be used. \n\nThen he asked me to implement couple of methods in the design, which I did. \nOverall, this went well as well.\n\n**Round 3(HLD):** And again, started with Leadership principles, which went on for half an hour. The HLD question was to Design Leetcode(any online judge). I did not practice HLD a lot. I fumbled in this round, but somehow I managed to complete the design.\n\nOverall, this was an ok round. \n\n\n**Round 4(Bar raiser):** Yet again, started with Leadership principles for 20 minutes. Then asked a DSA question - Something like task scheduler where each task has dependencies. He asked me to implement a solution which ensures there is not task starvation - this means I shouldn't be using a queue for visiting the tasks while doing the topological sorting. \n\nHe gave me a few clues and I was able to quickly grab those. \nThe solution was to implement topological sorting using DFS. \n\n\n\nAfter a week or so, I got the hire call.\nFinally after being rejected by google and Microsoft, it was nice to get an offer. \n\nMicrosoft Interview experience: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7015857/microsoft-swe-iii-hyderabad-by-anonymous-nt9n/\nGoogle Interview experience: https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6705226/google-swe-iii-interview-experience-hyde-e8d9/\n\n\nAmazon comp breakup:\n\nCurrent comp: 22LPA(20 fixed and 2 variable)\n\nFixed(base): 45LPA\nFirst year joining bonus: 19L\nSecond year joining bonus: 14.5L\nRelocation: 1.5L\nStocks: 50K$ - vested over four years - 5%, 15%, 40%, 40%\nRole: SDE - II\n\nFirst year total comp: 66LPA Approx.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Given this, is it feasible to switch later to big tech product-based companies with a similar tech stack or specialization, once I\u2019ve gained some experience? What are your opinions, suggestions / advices upon switching?\r\n\ud83d\udcdd Would it be better to switch out early (in 1\u20132 years), or is accumulating 4\u20135 years of PSU experience more beneficial before moving?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Education & Long-Term Exit Paths:**\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcdd Do PSUs offer opportunities for international collaborations, onsite projects, or sponsoring foreign degrees (like MTech/MS)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd1d **If you\u2019ve worked in either (or both) environments:**\r\nPlease share your detailed, comprehensive and honest take - day-to-day life, experiences, regrets (if any), and what you\u2019d choose if you had to start over. What would you do if you were in my shoes - early 20s, PSU offer in hand, strong CS fundamentals, and a willingness to explore? If you could go back in time, would you choose differently? Why ow Why not? Please reflect on this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\ude4f Thanks in advance!\r\nLooking forward to some deep insights from this community.

(I find singletons pointless unless we have code to create an object at multiple places but we only need 1 instance)\r\n    - Overall Interviewer was pretty uninterested. She left the interview 2 times to get Coffee.\r\n    - Design rounds are supposed to be a discussion.

This generally happens in person where they fly you down but I had it virtual due to some last minute challenges.\r\n\r\n### About myself\r\nCollege : Computer Science from Tier 1, 2025 grad\r\nExperience : 4 internships, 3 at startups and one at a MNC\r\n\r\n## Round 1\r\n2 DSA questions were asked; along with discussion on resume. The interviewers focus on why you did you did, and how was it done. This included the work experience as well as projects. \r\n\r\n### DSA questions\r\n\r\n- A standard array traversal where we are supposed to optimise to O(n) time with no extra space.\r\n\r\n- Array of postive integers is given; where elements can repeat. We are also given a target integer. Return the length of minimum subarray such that sum  integers in the subarray us greater or eaual to the target\r\n    - What happens the array contains negative numbers. How can we solve it then\r\n\r\n## Round 2\r\n\r\nWas a lot more focused on understanding the the subject. My resume contained operating systems projects and hence was asked on that. \r\n\r\n### DSA question\r\n- A very standard BST traversal logic. Had a lot of test cases we went through, what if the tree is skewed, negative values, etc. \r\n\r\n## Round 3\r\n\r\nThe goal is to understand if you fit with the culture at Zomato. Asked a few questions about why Zomato, my previous work experience and some examples of when I tackled issues, whether my mindset aligns with what they look for \r\n\r\n### Conclusions\r\n\r\nFocus on your resume, the interviewers don't ask questions for the sake of it. They will try to understand, will do their homework before asking you questions. Deep dives are common and expected. \r\n\r\nGood luck and all the best!\r\n\r\n"}

It's a visual blowout, a center point for motivation, and a strong showcasing device. However, for innovative organizations, essentially posting pretty pictures and slapping on a couple of hashtags isn't sufficient to slice through the commotion. To flourish, you want to develop a certified local area - a gathering of connected devotees who value your work as well as become faithful clients and supporters. This article investigates down-to-earth methodologies to assist you with moving past shallow commitment and constructing a flourishing local area on Instagram.\r\n\r\n**The Issue with Hashtag-Just Procedures:**\r\n\r\nWhile hashtags are fundamental for discoverability, depending exclusively on them makes a value-based approach. You're projecting a wide net, expecting to get anyone with any interest. This frequently prompts brief likes and follows, yet not significant associations. Genuine people group building requires a more purposeful and individual methodology.\r\n\r\n**Building a Real People group: Commonsense Advances:**\r\n\r\nCharacterize Your Optimal Client: Before you can interface with your crowd, you want to know what their identity is. Make a nitty gritty profile of your optimal client - their socioeconomics, interests, trouble spots, and desires. This will illuminate your substance system and assist you with drawing in the right supporters.\r\n\r\nShare Your Story, in Addition to Your Items: Individuals associate with stories, not simply attempts to sell something. Share the \"why\" behind your work. What moves you? What difficulties have you had? Allow your character to radiate through and make an association with your crowd on a more profound level. In the background glimpses, work-in-progress shots, and individual tales can staggeringly lock in.\r\n\r\nConnect Legitimately: Don't simply communicate; participate in discussion. Answer remarks and DMs, seek clarification on some things and partake in applicable discussions inside your specialty. Show veritable interest in your supporters and their accounts. This two-way connection is significant for building connections.\r\n\r\nMake Intuitive Substance: Surveys, tests, interactive discussions, and difficulties are incredible ways of supporting commitment and cultivating a feeling of the local area. Urge your devotees to take part and offer their points of view. This increments communication as well as gives important bits of knowledge about your crowd's inclinations.\r\n\r\nTeam up with Others: Joining forces with different makers in your specialty can open your work to a more extensive crowd and acquaint you with new potential local area individuals. Joint efforts can take many structures, from joint giveaways and yell-outs to co-made content and live streams.\r\n\r\nOffer Selective Worth: Prize your dedicated adherents with restrictive substance, limits, or early admittance to new items. This causes them to feel esteemed and appreciated, fortifying their association with your image.\r\n\r\nBe Predictable and Patient: Building a veritable local area takes time and exertion. Try not to get deterred on the off chance that you don't get results for the time being. Remain reliable with your posting plan, connect genuinely, and keep on offering some benefit to your crowd.\r\n\r\n**End:**\r\n\r\nBuilding a flourishing local area on Instagram is a venture that takes care of over the long haul. By moving past hashtag-just systems and zeroing in on certifiable associations, you can make a steadfast following that upholds your imaginative business and turns into your greatest supporter. It's actually not necessary to focus on the quantity of supporters you have, but on the nature of the connections you construct."}

This was supposed to be a system design round. The HR had informed me that the interview would consist of questions from OS, DBMS, Computer Science fundamentals, and OOPs\u2014essentially core subjects.\n\nFirstly, the interviewer joined 1.5 hours late. When he finally joined, he said, \u201cPlease allow me 2 minutes, I need to use the washroom.\u201d I politely said, \u201cGo ahead, sir.\u201d\n\nWhen he returned, the first thing he asked was, \u201cDo you know how a toilet flush works?\u201d\nHonestly, I didn\u2019t know the technical workings, but I had seen some Harpic advertisements on TV. So, I tried to answer by saying, \u201cSir, I think there's some rubber mechanism that holds water, and when we press the flush button, it releases the water.\u201d\n\nTo that, he bluntly replied, \u201cNahi aata to chup raho\u201d (If you don\u2019t know, keep your mouth shut).\nI understand that if I didn\u2019t know the answer, I should have stayed quiet\u2014but I thought giving a logical guess or intuition might show I'm trying.\n\nThen he asked me my favorite subject. I replied with a core subject that I enjoy. But he interrupted and said, \u201cNot from your core or engineering subjects.\u201d So I told him, \u201cSir, space fascinates me.\u201d\nHis counter-question was, \u201cIf you're stuck on a planet like Earth, how would you build a spaceship using only Earth\u2019s resources?\u201d\nI admitted honestly, \u201cSir, I don't know, I\u2019m from the CSE branch,\u201d especially since at the beginning of the interview he himself said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the answer, don\u2019t try to answer.\u201d\n\nNext, he shared his screen and showed 8 components. He asked me to build a steam engine using them. Again, I said, \u201cSorry sir, I don't know.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cNo worries, let\u2019s move to your technical skills.\u201d\nThen he asked me how a HashMap works in O(1) time complexity. Since I use Java, I explained how HashMaps work both before and after Java 8.\n\nAfter that, he simply said, your interview is over.\u201d\n\nThe next day, 6 students from our college reached the final round. 5 of them received offer letters and PPOs worth 27 LPA. I was the only one rejected.\n\nBelow is a summary of the interview process I cleared till Round 5. Thanks.\n\nNote to Juspay (or any senior officials who might see this):\nPlease ensure fairness and professionalism during interviews. This entire process spanned 2 months, and I dedicated myself wholeheartedly\u2014averaging only 5\u20136 hours of sleep daily. To be treated like this in the final round was deeply disheartening. Students work extremely hard to reach this stage, and interviews should be an opportunity to evaluate\u2014not humiliate.\n\n\n\n# Round 1: Online Coding Assessment\n3 medium to hard-level coding problems (Graphs, Trees)\nScored 300/300\n\n**Round 2: Technical MCQ Assessment**\n16 MCQs based on Physics, Mathematics, and CS Fundamentals\n\n**Round 3: Hackathon \u2013 Part A**\nA problem with 3 subtasks (Traditional Tree Space problem)\nPassed all 10/10 test cases\n\n# Round 4: Elimination Interview\nSolved 2 DSA problems\nInterviewer was very supportive and collaborative\n\n# Round 5: Hackathon \u2013 Part B (Slack-Based)\nWalkthrough of Part A solution\nDiscussion on optimization and thread safety using mutex/semaphore and without them\nInterviewer was very supportive and collaborative\n\n# Round 6: System Interview\nQuestions based on resume,some physics concepts,Probability question and building hardware components from scratch\n\nFinal Verdict: \u274c Rejected in the final round"}

If I leave before 1 year or so, it would look bad on them as they recommended a candidate who left early since they want someone who can remain for long term.

Both got rescheduled because of unavailablity of Interviewer. Though disheartened at that moment this worked out in my favour. As i wouldn't have been able to clear the System design at that time.\r\n\r\nDSA Round (27th May)\r\n- Only 1 interview was scheduled on this day.\r\n- First 10-15 mins went for the LP discussion. Recuriter informed me which 2 LP i have to prepare, so formed the STAR pattern answers for 8-10 questions.\r\n- 1st Question was variation of Max Island question, where we can change one 0 to 1 in the matrix and we need to find the largest island possible. Solved by finding all the components and greedily checked for each 0 what will the max island size if its changed to 1.\r\n- 2nd Questions was simple hashing based, don't remember the exact question but we only had a discussion on this no implementation as time was over.\r\n- Self Assesment - Hire/Strong Hire(Not sure because of the last question)\r\n\r\nLLD Round (17th June)\r\n- The round was initially scheduled for 10th but got rescheduled at the last moment.\r\n- Recuriter informed the 2 LP i need to prepare, went with the same approach as last time.\r\n- Initial 15 mins went in the LP discussion.\r\n- I was asked to design the Issue management system(Different priority, Escalations, Wait Queue).\r\n- Overall round went well and interviewer was satisfied with the solution.\r\n- Self Assesment - Strong Hire\r\n\r\nHLD Round (17th June)\r\n- Because of multiple rescheds i asked recruiter to schedule both rounds on same day if possible.\r\n- Recuriter informed the 2 LP i need to prepare, went with the same approach as last time.\r\n- I was asked to design Parking Lot system.\r\n- Since this was a HLD round and the question seems more like an LLD, i got a bit confused and ended up discussing the LLD, interviewer was supportive and still asked meaningful questions as per LLD.\r\n- Last 15 mins were utilised for LP, this time i was asked 4 questions based on the 2 LP i prepared.\r\n- Self Verdict - Lean Hire/Hire (Doubtfule because of LLD discussion in HLD)\r\n\r\nBar Raiser (23rd June)\r\n- Got a mail after two days that a bar raiser is scheduled and it will be based on HLD. I expected the same because of the above reasons and was preparing for the same.\r\n- First 10-15 mins went into LP discussion.\r\n- I was asked to design Amazon Locker System. Next 40-45 mins went very well. I was designing it for the first time but bits and pieces which i learned from other systems all got utilised here. For eg : I learnt about proximity service in some other question and it just fit well in this problem as well.\r\n- Interviewer asked few questions on the concurrency part and scaling, which i answered properly.\r\n- Overall i was happy from my performance and interviewer also seems to be satisfied.\r\n- Self Verdict - Strong Hire (Mostly because i was proud of what i designed)\r\n\r\n\r\nGot the congratulation mail after 2 days.\r\n\r\nHad verbal offer discussion two days after.\r\n\r\nVerbal Offer:\r\nBase Pay - 43\r\nBonus - 15.3 + 12\r\nRSU - 210\r\n\r\nTotal First Year CTC - ~60\r\n\r\nI feel like the offer is a bit low ball.

It\u2019s starting to feel off-balance, and honestly, a little unfair.\r\n\r\nLet me be crystal clear\u2014I have mad respect for QA engineers. I\u2019ve worked alongside some incredible QAs who\u2019ve caught critical bugs and saved our team from shipping disasters. They\u2019re vital to delivering solid software. But lately, at my current company (keeping it anonymous for obvious reasons), the way things are structured feels\u2026 well, lopsided.\r\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed:\r\n\r\n- **Equal pay, unequal perks.** At my company, QA and devs start with similar base salaries, which is fine. But then QA folks often snag bigger performance bonuses and extra goodies, like fully funded team outings that developers don\u2019t get invited to. Why the difference?\r\n\r\n- **QA gets the spotlight.** I can\u2019t count how many times I\u2019ve seen QAs get public shout-outs in team chats or all-hands meetings for catching bugs. Meanwhile, when a developer ships a rock-solid feature or designs a system that prevents issues through smart architecture, it\u2019s just another day at the office. No applause, no mention.\r\n\r\n- **More influence for QA.** There are moments when QA teams have a louder voice in sprint planning, release decisions, or even what features take priority. Developers, on the other hand, often feel like order-takers\u2014just handed tickets and expected to churn out code without much room to weigh in or challenge the plan.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong\u2014catching bugs is crucial. But so is writing clean, thoughtful code that keeps bugs at bay in the first place. It\u2019s disheartening to feel like your work is undervalued just because it\u2019s less visible or doesn\u2019t come with a dramatic \u201csave the day\u201d moment.\r\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t about pitting QA against devs\u2014we\u2019re all on the same team, working toward the same goal. But when companies set things up in a way that feels like a zero-sum game, it\u2019s the developers who end up feeling like they\u2019re building the foundation while QA gets to cut the ribbon at the grand opening.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s not just frustrating; it\u2019s demotivating. And over time, it\u2019s bound to hurt team morale and cohesion.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else seen this dynamic play out? Is it just my company, or is this becoming a broader trend? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts."}

Two hours later, I received an invitation for a technical interview.\n\nTechnical Interview: Complete a four part question in 60 minutes. After completing each part, the next part will be given to me, and there is a connection between the questions. I have completed three parts, all of which passed the test cases. The last part started with a tight schedule, so I only wrote a plan without testing. The next day, I received an invitation for an on-site interview.\n\nVO interview: 3 one hour sessions. The overall interview process and question types can be [referred to here](https://programhelp.net/vo/stripe-vo-interview-experience-sharing/). The question types are the same, SD is the original question, it's my fault for not reading it earlier ..\n\nThe first part is coding, which is basically a repetition of the phone interview, but this time it requires the use of built-in libraries. I only got two parts right. The interviewer looked a bit disappointed because I was not very familiar with these databases and had searched a lot of things.\n\nThe second part is to find bugs. \nTo be honest, this interviewer is a bit uncomfortable for me. Firstly, you need to identify the bug. At that time, he didn't give me 30 seconds to think. If I paused quietly for 5 seconds, he would interject and tell me what to do next. Sometimes when I'm about to say the next point I'm going to check, he interjects and says it, and it's exactly what I was about to say! I don't know if it's his personality, but I hope it doesn't make me look bad. Finally, he gave me a brief hint of where the bug was, and I immediately fixed it. Then he added a small issue, which I quickly resolved.\n\nThe third part is integration. Actually, it's just writing some POST request code for existing APIs, and there are many parts involved. I have finished four parts, but I don't have enough time. I don't know if they expect you to do more, but I have the most confidence in this round. This interviewer didn't interfere much with me, which is best for me because I need to be quiet to think.\n\nThe last round is the bq interview with HR, and I will let everyone know if I have any results.\nBy the way, my recruiter is super friendly and responds quickly. He is really a good person."}

Here's why I'm obsessed with them:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udde0 Introduction: Why QUEUE Matters\r\nIn the vast landscape of data structures, Queue stands out not for its complexity, but for its elegant simplicity and immense practical utility. Whether you\u2019re implementing algorithms, handling real-time systems, or optimizing workflows \u2014 queues are almost always involved.\r\n\r\nAt its heart, a queue follows the FIFO principle (First In, First Out) \u2014 meaning the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This linear ordering mechanism is surprisingly powerful and forms the backbone of many real-world systems and classical computer science problems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udd39 Conceptual Foundation of Queue\r\nFIFO: This is the defining feature. Unlike stacks (which are LIFO), queues preserve the order of arrival.\r\n\r\nLinear Data Structure: Items are arranged in a linear order, moving from the front (\ud83d\udd3c) to the rear (\ud83d\udd3d).\r\n\r\nSingle Access Point at Each End:\r\n\r\nEnqueue (\ud83d\udd3d): Add item at the rear\r\n\r\nDequeue (\ud83d\udd3c): Remove item from the front\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udce6 Real-World Analogies\r\nQueues mimic many real-life processes:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0f People lining up at a billing counter\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print job queue in a printer spool\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcde Call center waitlists\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfae Multiplayer game matchmaking systems\r\n\r\n\ud83e\uddfe OS-level CPU scheduling\r\n\r\nIn each case, entities are processed in the exact order they arrive, ensuring fairness and predictability.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udde9 Internal Structure\r\nQueues can be internally implemented in multiple ways:\r\n\r\n### 1. Array-Based Queue\r\nSimple to implement.\r\n\r\nHas a fixed size, so suffers from the \u201cfalse overflow\u201d problem (where space is unused at the front but not reused).\r\n\r\nPerformance is efficient for Enqueue/Dequeue if done carefully.\r\n\r\n### 2. Linked List-Based Queue\r\nUses dynamic memory allocation.\r\n\r\nNo fixed size limitation.\r\n\r\nEach node points to the next; enqueue at tail, dequeue from head.\r\n\r\nEfficient for dynamic workloads.\r\n\r\n### 3. Circular Queue\r\nSolves the overflow issue of array queues.\r\n\r\nUses modular arithmetic to wrap around.\r\n\r\nUseful in buffer management (e.g., circular buffers in audio processing or streaming).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\uddec Types of Queues\r\n### \ud83d\udd38 1. Simple Queue\r\nBasic FIFO behavior.\r\n\r\nSupports Enqueue and Dequeue operations at opposite ends.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd38 2. Circular Queue\r\nThe last position is connected to the first.\r\n\r\nOptimizes space by reusing emptied spaces.\r\n\r\nCommon in buffering and streaming systems.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd38 3. Priority Queue\r\nElements are served based on priority, not just arrival time.\r\n\r\nImplemented typically using heaps.\r\n\r\nUsed in:\r\n\r\nDijkstra\u2019s Algorithm\r\n\r\nA* Search\r\n\r\nCPU scheduling (e.g., Shortest Job First)\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd38 4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue)\r\nSupports insertion and deletion from both ends.\r\n\r\nCan work as both stack and queue.\r\n\r\nExtremely flexible.\r\n\r\nWidely used in sliding window problems and LRU cache implementations.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd38 5. Monotonic Queue\r\nSpecial form of queue that maintains elements in monotonic order.\r\n\r\nUsed in problems like:\r\n\r\nSliding Window Maximum\r\n\r\nMin/Max Queue\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd38 6. Multiple Queues in an Array\r\nEfficient memory usage by storing multiple queues in a single array.\r\n\r\nUsed in OS memory or process scheduling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u2699\ufe0f Internal Operations (Behind the Scenes)\r\nEach operation on a queue is governed by internal mechanisms:\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Enqueue:\r\nSpace check \u2192 Is there room to add?\r\n\r\nPlace the element at the rear.\r\n\r\nMove rear pointer accordingly.\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Dequeue:\r\nEmpty check \u2192 Is the queue non-empty?\r\n\r\nRemove element from front.\r\n\r\nMove front pointer forward.\r\n\r\nThese pointers (front/rear) are either indices (in arrays) or references (in linked lists). Proper pointer management is crucial to avoid errors like underflow (dequeue from empty) or overflow (enqueue into full fixed-size queue).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \u23f1\ufe0f Time Complexity Summary\r\nOperation\tTime Complexity\r\nEnqueue\tO(1)\r\nDequeue\tO(1)\r\nPeek/Front\tO(1)\r\nSearch\tO(n)\r\n\r\nThis constant time complexity for main operations makes the queue ideal for time-critical applications.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# \ud83e\udde0 Classical Problems Using Queues*\r\nUnderstanding queues is incomplete without recognizing how foundational they are in algorithmic problem-solving:\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udd39 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)\r\nTraverses nodes level by level.\r\n\r\nQueue ensures correct exploration order.\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udd39 2. Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph\r\nBFS again \u2014 tracks levels through queue.\r\n\r\nQueue ensures minimal steps to reach target.\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udd39 3. Sliding Window Maximum\r\nUses deque to maintain max elements in O(n) time.\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udd39 4. First Non-Repeating Character in Stream\r\nQueue tracks character order.\r\n\r\nHashmap + Queue combo detects non-repeating elements efficiently.\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udd39 5. LRU Cache\r\nQueue + Hashmap or LinkedHashMap in Java.\r\n\r\nMaintains order of access for eviction strategy.\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udd39 6. Task Scheduling\r\nSimulates real OS scheduling.\r\n\r\nQueue manages which tasks are next.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udcda Interview-Level Questions on Queues\r\nImplement a queue using stacks (\ud83e\udde0 tests understanding of both structures).\r\n\r\nReverse a queue using recursion (\ud83d\udcd0 conceptual depth).\r\n\r\nDesign a circular queue (\u2699\ufe0f focus on pointer wrapping).\r\n\r\nMax sliding window (\ud83d\udcca tests deque mastery).\r\n\r\nRotten oranges / Flood fill / Maze problems (\ud83d\udccd BFS + queue).\r\n\r\nThese questions are extremely common in FAANG-level interviews and platform contests (like on LeetCode, Codeforces, or CodeChef).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\udded Where Queues Truly Shine\r\nQueues might seem basic at first, but their power lies in their discipline and predictability. In multi-threaded systems, pipelines, simulations, and more, queues maintain the order, ensure fairness, and help prevent bottlenecks.\r\n\r\nThey also serve as building blocks for more complex structures:\r\n\r\nGraphs \u2192 BFS uses queues\r\n\r\nTrees \u2192 Level-order traversal\r\n\r\nHeaps \u2192 Priority Queues\r\n\r\nCaching \u2192 Deques (for LRU)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## \ud83e\uddea Pros and Cons\r\n### \u2705 Advantages\r\nSimple and intuitive.\r\n\r\nConstant time operations.\r\n\r\nMultiple variants for flexible use.\r\n\r\nStrong real-world parallels.\r\n\r\n### \u274c Disadvantages\r\nSearching is linear (O(n)).\r\n\r\nFixed-size queues (arrays) can waste space unless circular.\r\n\r\nPoor for scenarios needing random access.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udd1a Conclusion\r\nThe Queue data structure is a paragon of elegance and efficiency. Its simplicity allows for fast operations, while its variants extend its utility into advanced algorithmic and system-level tasks. Whether you're a beginner learning data structures or an experienced developer optimizing concurrent systems, mastering queues is non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\n\r\n\u201cQueue is not just a line \u2014 it\u2019s a philosophy of fairness, order, and efficiency.\u201d \ud83d\udd04\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udccc Join the discussion!\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your favorite queue-based problem?\r\n\r\nHave you ever used monotonic queues in competitive coding?\r\n\r\nWhich implementation do you prefer \u2014 array, linked list, or deque?\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udc47 Drop your thoughts below and let\u2019s make this thread the longest FIFO chain ever! \ud83d\ude04\r\n\u2795 FIFO (First In, First Out) \u2192 Simple yet powerful!\r\n\r\n\u23f3 Used in:\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udd04 BFS (Breadth-First Search)\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f CPU Scheduling\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Print Queues\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udf10 Network Packet Routing\r\n\r\n\u267b\ufe0f Circular Queues = Space Optimization!\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udcda Implemented using arrays, linked lists, stacks, even two queues!\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f My Favorite Implementations:\r\nQueue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>(); // Java\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Implementations:\r\ncollections.deque() // Python (double-ended magic!)\r\n\r\nstd::queue<int> q; // C++\r\n\r\nQueue = \u2728 elegant + essential \u2728\r\nWho else is on Team Queue? \ud83d\ude0d\r\n\ud83d\udc47 Share your favorite use-case!"}

These are some of the most active ones:\r\n\r\n| Rank | Company         | Common Focus Areas               |\r\n| ---- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |\r\n| 1    | Google          | Graphs, DP, System Design        |\r\n| 2    | Amazon          | Arrays, Hashing, Sliding Window  |\r\n| 3    | Microsoft       | Strings, Trees, Bit Manipulation |\r\n| 4    | Meta (Facebook) | Graphs, Recursion, DP            |\r\n| 5    | Apple           | BFS/DFS, Sorting, Trees          |\r\n| 6    | Netflix         | Greedy, Intervals, Design        |\r\n| 7    | Bloomberg       | Heaps, HashMaps, OOD             |\r\n| 8    | Adobe           | Math, Binary Search, Recursion   |\r\n| 9    | Tesla           | Simulation, Arrays, Design       |\r\n| 10   | Oracle          | SQL, Linked Lists, Arrays        |\r\n\r\n\r\n# \ud83d\udcda Strategy to Use LeetCode for Company-Specific Prep\r\nUse the \"Top Interview Questions\" Filter\r\nLeetCode allows filtering by company.

I am an ICPC regionalist, have a 1700 Codeforces rating, and have solved more than 600+ questions on LeetCode (just for your reference on how good I am on a scale).\r\n\r\nBut even being from a Tier 1 college, since my branch is non-circuital, I wasn't allowed to sit for any IT placements, except one \u2014 Dassault Syst\u00e8mes. The interview lasted 6 hours, and I was the only candidate who had 3 rounds of interviews, unlike others. Everyone thought I would definitely make it, but ironically, they selected 10 others except me. The reason might be that I told the HR that I want to build something of my own in the next 10 years. That innocent answer cost me in this fake corporate world and I got rejected.\r\n\r\nNow, the fact is that most of my friends are from circuital branches, and my closest friend, who knows up to Linked Lists (and that too very little) and solved nearly 40\u201350 questions, recently got a PPO from Amazon. I still remember I was sitting beside him showing him answers during his interview.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve observed that companies like Microsoft, AMEX, Amazon, NatWest, etc., recently have literally hired cheaters from on-campus. They have no idea how bad some of the selected candidates are.\r\n\r\nDuring the very end of placement season, I cracked a core company on-campus with an 8 LPA CTC. It was a mass hiring, and I had no other option so I applied. Even my family didn\u2019t want me to join service-based companies like TCS, Infosys, and I myself didn\u2019t want to go there either. I\u2019ve seen the struggle of the last 22 years, and I don\u2019t want to put all this knowledge into any mass-hiring company.\r\nYou think, would you switch into TCS, infosys with package of 3.3-7 LPA while you have a job of 60k per month in your own state.\r\nYou guys have even no idea.. how i have seen my life. The struggle i have put up is like hell. I did not even made any relationship thinking it might hamper my career and all  those with so called GenZ and multiple relationships clubs bars are into MNCs. Now how would you belive god... huh ?? These are making me atheist. But Still I belive cosmos broke you before make you. Ok leave this.\r\n\r\nAnd if you're reading this, you should know how screwed up my college is. It follows a \"one student, one job\" policy \u2014 but not for circuital branches. WTF. I still remember that circuital students, especially girls (I\u2019m not gender-biased, I truly believe in feminism), were allowed multiple offers \u2014 BNY, AMEX, and still sat for Amazon, Apple, because there were more companies than students in their case. One girl even failed to reverse a string in a Salesforce interview \u2014 she was from CSE. \r\n\r\nNow, you might say it\u2019s my fault I didn\u2019t get into a circuital branch. For your reference, I got 97.8 percentile, and I am a pure general category student. My father had no clue about this EWS certificate, otherwise people being general with EWS got EE, EC, EI with 96.6 percentile at my college. Most CSE guys had 99.99 percentile, and all were from Bihar. Their percentile trend was like 6 percentile, 43 percentile, 99.99 percentile \u2014 how? Complete scam. They don\u2019t even know log(x), e^x, etc.\r\n\r\nNow I\u2019m messaging and cold emailing a lot on LinkedIn, but haven\u2019t gotten a single response. What should I do, guys? Please suggest."}

This post is a small way of giving back \u2014 especially for those currently in the pipeline or preparing for the SDE-1 role at Amazon.\n\nI\u2019ll be sharing my complete interview experience \u2014 from start to finish.\n\n---\n\n### **Profile Snapshot**\n\n* **Experience:** 1.5 years\n* **Previous Company:** Mobility-based well-known startup\n* **Position Offered:** SDE-1\n* **Total Duration:** \\~4 months\n* **Rounds:** All were eliminatory\n\n---\n\n### **1. Online Assessment (OA)**\n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact questions, but both required either a dynamic programming or mathematical approach. I solved them analytically using math.\nNote: It took almost **30 days** post-assessment to receive the next update.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Technical Round 1**\n\n#### **Q1. Binary Tree Validation**\n\nGiven a list of TreeNode objects (`val`, `left`, `right`), determine whether they form a valid binary tree.\nExample:\n`[TN(1, 2, 3), TN(2, None, None), TN(3, None, None)] \u2192 True`\n\n\ud83d\udd39 It seems simple, but it\u2019s a very elegant question.\n\ud83d\udd39 I started from scratch \u2014 defining classes, clean variable names, modular functions, and explained everything as I went.\n\n#### **Q2. Drone Delivery Route**\n\nProblem described an array representing drone positions. I was asked to model an efficient delivery tracking logic.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Solved it within 8 minutes.\n\ud83d\udd39 Explained my full thought process clearly \u2014 intuition first, code next.\n\ud83d\udd39 By this point, the interviewers seemed very satisfied.\n\n#### **Leadership Principles (LP):**\n\n* A time when you went through fast-paced learning.\n* How would you approach learning a new language/framework used in the company?\n\n---\n\n### **3. Technical + LP + Design Round**\n\n#### **Leadership Principles:**\n\n1. A time when you did more than what was required, anticipating customer needs.\n2. The most technically challenging task you\u2019ve worked on.\n\n#### **System Design:**\n\n**Design a flexible music playlist system** \u2014 create and manage playlists, handle song playback, etc.\nI began by discussing everything I was thinking out loud and explaining each step of implementation. However, I sensed that the interviewer wasn\u2019t very engaged. Still, I stayed calm and continued articulating my thoughts clearly.\n\n**Feedback:**\n\n> *\"Try to align better with the interviewer\u2019s expectations, but DSA, design thinking, and code quality were strong.\"*\n\n---\n\n### **4. Bar Raiser Round**\n\nThe interviewer had 8+ years of experience.\n\n\ud83d\udd39 Started with mutual introductions.\n\ud83d\udd39 Asked about my past projects \u2014 I discussed two in depth.\n\ud83d\udd39 Questions on architecture, tech stack choices, and alternative tools.\n\nEventually, he compared my stack with unfamiliar ones. I was honest and said:\n\n> *\"I\u2019ve explored limited tools so far due to time constraints, but what I used worked well for my project needs with zero production issues. I\u2019m always open to learning more.\"*\n\nMy responses were **clear, confident, and honest**, especially around topics I truly understood \u2014 and I didn\u2019t bluff where I wasn\u2019t 100% confident.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Outcome \ud83c\udf89**\n\nAfter 7 days, the recruiter called:\n\n> *\u201cYou got very good response from HM and also other candidates were in the list, so we are going with you first, please let us know  . We\u2019d like to move forward with your offer.\u201d*\n\nOf course, I said YES!\n\n---\n\n### **A Few Notes for Aspirants:**\n\n* **Be patient** \u2014 the process takes time (it was 4 months for me).\n* **Follow up** \u2014 If there's delay, don\u2019t hesitate to reply to the interview invite email or recruiter contact.\n* **Clarity over fluff** \u2014 Speak only what you\u2019re sure of. Depth matters more than breadth.\n* **Prep leadership principles** as much as DSA and LLD/System Design.\n* **Interviewer\u2019s engagement** might vary \u2014 keep your calm and keep delivering quality.\n\n---\n\nHappy to answer if you\u2019re preparing for Amazon or similar interviews.\nFeel free to DM or drop questions in the comments \ud83d\ude4c\n\n\n"}

For the Staff role, they have total of 6 rounds: 1 Screening and 5 online rounds\r\n\r\nHere is the breakdown of all the rounds:\r\n\r\n**Round 1: Screening**\r\n\r\nIn this round, Firstly, I was asked to give my detailed career intro along with leadership/project related questions:\r\n\r\n1. Conflicting situations faced in any critical project\r\n2. Impactful project from which I was able to move out to other project with minimal disruption\r\n\r\nFew follow-ups were there and this discussion lasted for around 20 mins\r\n\r\nThen, I got a LC Hard DSA question : https://leetcode.com/problems/max-stack/\r\nI discussed 2-3 most optimal approaches and the interviewer agreed on one of the approaches to code it for all the helper methods along with discussion on Space and Time Complexity. Also, I was asked to dry run on a pre-written TC.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 2: DSA 1: Staff Coding - Apps**\r\n\r\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring\r\nThe problem was extended to a condition when the source string is wrapped around.\r\n\r\nQ2: Shortest path between LinkedIn connections. An adjacency list is given, a source and a target. Find the connection distance between source and target. Print the path as well.\r\nI discussed the optimal solution : Bi-directional BFS and coded for the same.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n\r\n**Round 3: DSA 2: Staff Coding & Algorithms 2**\r\n\r\nQ1: https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder\r\nI gave the most optimized O(M*N) approach inspired by the below link:\r\nhttps://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/submissions/1595132398\r\n\r\nQ2: https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii\r\nGave the optimal 2-pointer approach.\r\nExtension: For the scenario if one string's occurences are less than other, used binary search for the more frequent string.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 4: System Design**\r\n\r\nInitially, this round started with project and leadership based questions. Don't remember the exact questions, Apologies.\r\nNext, the interviewer covered the most complex project I recently led and covered about the security aspects and challenges faced. There were multiple follow-ups to understand my roles and responsibilities working as a tech lead.\r\n\r\nNext, I was given the below system design problem:\r\n\r\nDesign a flexible in-memory cache with customizable capacity and eviction policies.\r\n\r\nThe cache should allow users to define:\r\n  1.  Capacity: Specify how much data the cache can hold based on memory resources and data size.\r\n  2.  Eviction Policy: Choose strategies for removing items when the cache is full, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) or Lowest Priority.\r\n\r\nThis flexibility ensures the cache can be tailored to meet specific requirements, balancing resource usage and performance.\r\n\r\nOnce the LLD created was agreed with the interviewer, it was extended from HLD perspective for multiple nodes in distributed system setup covering all the challenges and other adhoc scenarios like hot key issue for a write-heavy setup. Also, discussion went around few Redis related internals.\r\n\r\nRating : Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 5: Craftsmanship**\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a behavioral based round for Staff role. It covered 8-10 scenario questions with internal follow ups. Questions were as follows:\r\n\r\n-> How do you define a quality product/system?\r\n-> Describe your strategy regarding code reviews\r\n-> Talk about a project that had many junior engineers and how I kept the project quality high/ If your team keeps growing and you get more junior engineers, what do you do?\r\n-> As a hypothetical situation, Imagine you join LinkedIn on a massive team that owns a legacy application. The application lacks adequate testing and monitoring and has slow response times. Consumers complain about this. Deployment of the application often contains bugs. What efforts would you do as a Staff SWE?\r\n-> Rank the following in terms of priority: bugs, no testing, no monitoring, slowness. What do you tackle first? How do you eventually turn this into micro services?\r\n-> What do you look for when determining the success of a service?\r\n-> What are your principles of mentorship? How do you manage technical and non-technical mentorship?\r\n-> Talk about a time where you helped grow engineers\r\n-> Few questions which were aligning with the LinkedIn values. Don't remember the exact questions.\r\nNote: Please be well-versed about Linkedin values.\r\n\r\nRating : Strong Hire\r\n\r\n**Round 6: Host Manager**\r\n\r\nThis round started with an elaborate introduction of both me and the interviewer.\r\n\r\nQuestions were as follows:\r\n1. Talk in detail about the most complex and challenging project I led in the recent times which had a very large scale. I framed my answer step-by-step as follows (along with few follow-ups from the HM):\r\n-> Team and My role\r\n-> Customer Problem & Business impact\r\n-> Key architectural decisions led/taken by me\r\n-> Biggest challenges faced and how did I overcome\r\n-> How did I maintain timely execution of the project\r\n-> Changes in reqs/unexpected blockers\r\n-> Ensuring alignment with stakeholders\r\n\r\n2. Why looking for change? Why LinkedIn?\r\n3. Describe a situation where you showed operational excellence.\r\n4. Describe a situation where you suggested improvements in the project which other engineers in the team could leverage from.\r\n\r\nThen at the end, he threw a HLD problem for designing a LinkedIn internal notification system which can handle a very large scale.\r\nThere were few cross-questions regarding the different internal microservices and Kafka being used for async handling.\r\nThis just had 10-15 mins at the end. Luckily, I was able to create the HLD diagram covering all the components.\r\n\r\n**Verdict** : Selected for the staff role after a week.\r\n\r\n**Compensation details :** \r\nBase salary: 88 LPA\r\nTarget bonus : 13.2 LPA (min 15%)\r\nPF : 4.25 LPA\r\nRSU: 350k for 4 years (75.5 LPA)\r\nRelocation bonus/services: ~ 5-7 L\r\nNet CTC per year : 1.85 Cr PA (++ unlimited LinkedIn Perks)\r\nYOE : 10\r\nCurrent CTC : 63 LPA (Microsoft : Senior SWE)\r\n\r\nHad another competing offers from Salesforce and Atlassian (~1.4 Cr PA), but finally I accepted the LinkedIn offer due to a better role and compensation.\r\n\r\nThanks to the Leetcode community for helping during my preparation and it's my time to give back to the community. Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

I used a Line Sweep algorithm with a difference array approach.\n- Follow-up: Discussed strategies to handle large input files efficiently.\n- Leadership Principles (LPs): Focused on a project where I had to dive deep into technical data, propose solutions, and influence decisions. Got a lot of follow-ups on alternate approaches and what I could have done differently.\n\nRound 1: Low-Level Design\n- Topic: Design a monitoring and alert generation system based on metric streams.\n- Focus Areas: System extensibility, clean abstractions, and alert thresholds.\n- LPs: Insist on Highest Standards \u2014 discussion around setting quality benchmarks in large-scale React migrations.\n\nRound 2: High-Level Design\n- Topic: Hotel Booking System \u2014 end-to-end design for search and booking flows.\n- Expectations: Scalability, DB design, eventual consistency, and system evolution.\n- LPs: Dealing with ambiguity, long-term thinking.\n\nRound 3: DSA + Coding\nProblems:\n\n- [Task Scheduler](https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/)\n- [Bus Routes](https://leetcode.com/problems/bus-routes/)\n- LPs: Deliver Results \u2014 strong emphasis on impact and reliability.\n\nRound 4: Hiring Manager Round\n- Deep dive into past projects involving conflict management, mentorship, and delivering large-scale features.\n- Behavioral sections covered how I proposed initiatives that were initially rejected but eventually adopted.\n\nRound 5: Bar Raiser\n- Focused on innovation, design leadership, and proactive debugging.\n- Wanted detailed, structured examples of technical ownership and measurable impact.\n\n# **Offer**\n\n- Base: 85LPA\n- First Year Sign-on: ~50LPA\n- Second Year Sign-on: ~40LPA\n- RSUs: ~600 units (Back Loaded, Y1-5%, Y2-15%, Y3-40%, Y4-40%)\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n- Amazon interview loop is as much about system design and DSA as it is about how you demonstrate ownership and decision-making (LPs) through your past work.\n- Be ready for follow-up questions, they really dig into \"why\" and \"how\" behind each decision.\n- Most of the interviews went well beyond 60 minutes especially the HM round.\n- **Rejected** the offer\n\nYoE: 11 Years\nCurrent TC: ~1.2Cr PA\n\n"}

To bridge the gap between where I am and where I want to be, I need to deepen my understanding of advanced backend concepts and system design.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### I\u2019d greatly appreciate guidance on:\r\n\r\n* **What should I learn beyond basic CRUD APIs?**\r\n* Should I start with **Low-Level Design (LLD), High-Level Design (HLD), or full System Design?** Any good resources for design \u2013 courses, articles, or YouTube channels?\r\n* Which core backend concepts should I go deep into (e.g., distributed systems, scalability, caching, queues, microservices, API gateways, NGINX)? What are some good resources or real-world project ideas to strengthen these concepts?\r\n* **Where can I find and practice backend/system design interview-type questions?**\r\n* Any personal experiences, roadmaps, or cheat-sheets that helped you grow faster?\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI\u2019m highly motivated to increase my earnings, and for that, I\u2019m ready to learn **anything** needed to grow technically and professionally. Right now, I\u2019m fully willing to invest extra time\u2014even **10+ hours a day** if required\u2014to upskill and take on challenging roles. While I may aim for better work-life balance in the future, at this stage, I\u2019m focused on **maximizing learning and income** through hard work and consistent effort.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for any suggestions, pointers, or learning paths you can share! \ud83d\ude0a\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

The process consisted of three elimination based rounds \u2014 two technical rounds followed by a hiring manager round.\n\n#### Round 1 (Medium to Hard Level):\nThe interview began with a brief introduction, and then the interviewer directly moved into problem-solving. The first question was to find the maximum element in a binary tree. Once I solved that, she followed up with another dsa problem similar to [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/). I was able to solve both problems in about 30 minutes, so she gave me another question similar to [Asteroid Collision](https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/description/) .\n\n### **Round 2 (Hard Level)**:\nThis round was conducted by a senior engineer and started off unexpectedly with questions from **Operating System** concepts. I was asked to explain topics like defragmentation, thrashing, and other memory management concepts, there were questions from virtual memory as well. The interviewer deep-dived into each concept. Then we moved into C++, where I was asked about the auto storage class, and to explain virtual functions with an example and describe their use case. After the theory part, I was given a dsa problem \u2014 a twisted version of the **LRU Cache**. I had to explain my logic and write pseudo-code.The interviewer went through it in detail and asked follow-up questions on each part of my implementation. Finally, I was given a problem similar to  [Reverse Nodes in K Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/description/) . We were short on time, so I explained my approach and wrote the pseudo-code.\n\n### **Round 3 (Medium Level)**:\nThe hiring manager started by asking how the previous rounds went and then transitioned into a resume-based discussion. I was asked to explain the projects I had worked on at my previous organization, the role I played, and how I contributed to runtime improvements through my code changes. The conversation then shifted to **object-oriented design**. I was asked to explain the Singleton class, how to ensure thread safety in its implementation, and to write the code for it. This was followed by a deep-dive discussion on abstraction, virtual classes, vtable, and vptr.\n\nHope this helps with your preparation! If it did, an **upvote** would be really encouraging! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcaa\n\n\n"}

I\u2019m reaching out to gather some perspectives as I\u2019m a bit uncertain about whether to accept the offer.\n\nBackground:\n\nI have close to 4 years of experience working at a product-based startup.\n\nCurrent Company \u2013 Pros:\n\n1. Decent compensation and work-life balance\n2. Work from office (WFO) with flexible hours\n3. Work from home (WFH) is allowed when requested upto 4 in a month(though this flexibility is gradually being reduced)\n\nCurrent Company \u2013 Cons:\n1. Learning and growth have become stagnant\n2. Frequent and unclear policy changes\n3. Silent layoffs are happening \u2014 feels like a ticking time bomb\n4. Compensation isn't growing at a satisfying pace + have been there for 4 years\n\nNew Offer \u2013 Pros:\n\n1. Approximately a 25% hike in the cash component\n2. Steeper learning curve\n3. The company appears to be growing steadily\n\nNew Offer \u2013 Cons:\n\n1. Strict 5-day WFO with fixed entry hours\n2. Long working hours (10\u201311 hours/day), with increased pressure towards the end of the week to complete the deadlines\n3. Heavy workload, resulting in almost no work-life balance\n4. I noticed on LinkedIn that the tech team is relatively small (around 8\u20139 backend engineers), and most of them appear to have less experience than me. While I\u2019m not judging, I do feel this might limit opportunities to learn from more experienced peers, which is something I value at this stage in my career.\n\nMy Dilemma:\n\nShould I put in my papers at the current company and treat this startup offer as a backup in case I don't land something better soon? Or should I stay put until I get an offer that\u2019s more aligned with my expectations? I'm prioritizing both learning and mental health.\n\nI\u2019d genuinely appreciate your advice and insights. I\u2019m sure many of you have been through similar crossroads and can relate to the confusion.\n\nThanks in advance!"}

Later I got the schedule, but this is where I occurred alot of issues. I had this round re-scheduled a total of **7 times**, with most of the times interviewer simply did not show up without any prior communication. Really lost hope and in the end, but atlast my interview did happen.\n\n### Questions:\n1. Problem 1 : https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/\n- Came up with a solution in under 15-20mins, medium dificulty.\n2. Problem 2: Similar to : https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/\n- Hard Difficulty (for me), Although I had solved this prior, I had no idea for the optimal solution. I tried to come up with an optimal approach, came up with a solution, but did not have the time left to code. Interviewer was mildly satisfied. \n\n3. Standard LP questions\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Round 3 \u2013 Bar Raiser (Behavioral + LP + DSA)\n\n**Date:** May 2025\n**Duration:** ~60 minutes  \n**Platform:** Amazon Chime\n**Note** : Got a mail after a week of round-2 that i have cleared the round, and they are acitvely working on scheduling my round -3. Got a call from Loop scheduler 1.5 weeks after for the round to be scheduled on Saturday, I immediately agreed (as I had 0 holidays left due Round-2 being re-scheduled so many times), and I got the mail for schedule. Suprisingly there were two interviewers, one really senior, one SDE-2.\nOne more thing, this specific mail did not have live code link, thus I was not expecting a DSA question, but in the interview it was asked.\n\n### Format:\n- 30 mins LP Questions.\n- 30 mins DSA Question\n\n### Questions:\n1. **Leadership Principles**  \n  - Tell me about a time you got feedback\n  - Tell me about a time you faced critical issues\n  - Tell me about a time you went beyond your task/job\n  - Follow ups on all\n\n2. **DSA**\n- Problem : https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-nice-subarrays/description/\n- Came up with a 2-pass approach, interviewer was satisfied enough, medium difficulty.\n\n---\n## Current Package\n\n**CTC** : 7 LPA\n**YOE** : 9 Months\n___\n\n## \ud83d\udcec Offer\n\n**Role:** SDE-1  \n**Location:** Bengaluru\n**Date** : June 2025\n\n**Package** : \n**Base Pay** : 19,17,000\n**Sign-on Bonus Year 1 (INR)**: 6,47,000\n**Sign-on Bonus Year 2 (INR)** :5,18,000\n**Restricted Stock Unit Value (RSU) (4 years)(INR)**:15,56,000\n\n**Total CTC** : 48 L + \n\n**Note**: Recieved the offer after almost 2.5 weeks after the the last round, I was constantly mailing the loop scheduler back and in the end the recruiter finally called me.\n\n___\n\n### Tips (Important)\n\n- Solve standard DSA sheets, interview questions are mostly asked around these with most of them being medium difficulty.\n- Dont wait for the reply, simply mail the loop scheduler mail back for an update, my loop mail thread was around **40 mails**.\n- For LP questions, prepare a list of 30-40 questions, you can easily find on leetcode, and run a deep research query on chatgpt along with your resume, get STAR based answers, and have follow up answers also prepared.\n\n___\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n\nI am really grateful to recieve this offer and finally my hardwork did pay off.

Want to give back to community.\n\n\nThis is in continuation to my last post I posted few months earlier \n\nhttps://leetcode.com/discuss/post/5688796/what-am-i-doing-wrong-with-interview-pre-4ne9/\n\nTC - 75LPA\nYOE - 5Y\n\n# Journey\n\nI was facing lot of issues in getting interview and was very frustated, to summarize I had started preparation in May'24 and by end of the year I had given interviews of almost all major companies and lots of startups and mid sized comapnies with just one very low balled offer. Few ghosted after clearing all the rounds and many gave random reasons for rejection. \nI was devasted after getting all these rejections but fortunately decided not to give up, kept working for it.\n\n# Results\n\nComing to Mar'25 I got my first offer which I thought is a good one. It's a mid-sized company and they were good work in e-commerce domain, I was particularly very excited but decided its time to move on and took the offer. I had few interviews lined up and this is when things started to really work in my favour. Few days after this I got an acceptance from Microsoft. I was very very happy, they offered lot better compensation and we all know about the perks. I kept giving interviews in my lineup, later on converted Uber and Atlassian as well. I was waiting on writing this post as I was yet to hear from Amazon and got an acceptance from Amazon as well. I have decided to go ahead with Atlassian but I am now very confident that I would be able to get the most out of myself and work to my full potential with confidence.\n\n# Why am I writing this ? \n\nThis is not a brag post, I generally don't like to talk about this. I am writing this to tell anyone who is going through the same phase as I was few months back that if you keep working towards it you will definitely see results. I myself had kinda given up and thought that there is no pickng up my career from here but kept faith in myself and made it work. This post is to tell you to keep faith in yourself and keep all the negative thoughts out of your mind and just keep working towards it. Also I have learnt a lot from going through different leetcode posts and this is my way of giving back to the community, I would also be answering each and every question in detail and to best of my abilities. \n\n# What I would do differently going ahead ? \n\n1. Being organized really really help, keep a tab on the list of comapnies you can apply and keep following up.\n2. LinkedIn network work, I am in the process of optimizing my linkedin network so I can see more relevant posts which would give me good market overview. \n3. Organized studies - I was always hoping that next comapny should be the one and therefore was always just studying keeping the next interview I have in mind because of which I had to go through many things repeatdely. Instead focusing on the next interview I would focus on all the topics I have to cover and study them in depth.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nMany thanks to everyone who has been directly or indirectly part of my journey and helped me, thanks to the community. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t"}

During my time interviewing, I read a lot of other peoples' posts here to give me encouragement. I hope this post does the same for others. The total timeline from recruitment to signing was 6 months. My story is really long to help those who need details. Best of luck to everyone. Don't give up!\n\n### My Background\n \nI have 6 years of experience at Amazon and two prior internships. \n\n### Recruitment \n\nI met a meta recruiter at Grace Hopper, but generally Meta, Google, and other FAANG companies email or linkedin message me. I applied after Grace Hopper in November and heard back in 2 weeks. I scheduled my phone screen for January since I planned to work full time until I got an offer. \n\n### Phone Screen\n\n#### Studying\n\nI prepared for 2 months for 20 hours a week. I went over the top 150 meta tagged questions 2-3 times. I looked at multiple optimal solutions. I paid for 1 mock interview with an ex-meta engineer and did multiple practice rounds for free on Exponent with strangers.\n\n#### Interview\n\nOn the phone screen day, both questions were from the top 50 meta tagged questions. I got strong feedback the next day and moved onto the onsite. \n\n### Onsite \n\nMy system design was infra. I have experience in both infra and product work. I took off about 3 2 week vacations to study 40 hours a week. When I was working, I study 20 hours a week.\n\n#### Studying\n\n##### System Design\n\nMy onsite was in April because I needed a lot of time to prepare for the system design because I never had a system design interview before. I was hired at Amazon straight from college. For system design I read Alex Xu's book, although it was outdated. Then I did every problem on Hello Interview 2-3 times and reviewed their youtube videos and written guides 2-3 times. TBH there are more online resources for product than infra questions on Hello Interview. I scheduled a paid system design mock with an ex-meta engineer. This process took about 5 weeks.\n\n##### Leetcode\n\nThen I went over the top 150 meta tagged coding questions over and over again until I could do all of them in 10-15 mins. I made sure I spoke outloud in the meta format of asking clarifying questions, explaining my plan, confirming the plan was valid, explaining trade offs if there were multiple good solutions, saying the time and space complexity, coding, and going through at least 1 example. The important part for me was doing all of this in 10 minutes if I could. I memorized the solutions, but also made sure I could explain every line of code.\n\nMy next step was to make sure I could do variants. I watched all of the variants from this channel https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithMinmer and then solved them myself. I did some of them twice if they were harder.\n\nI redid all the hard meta tagged top 150 questions one more time 2 days before the interview. This took me 6 weeks. \n\n##### Behavioral\n\nI collected previously asked meta behavioral questions from hello interview and general behavioral questions (about 30-40 questions). I practiced speaking all of them.\n\nThen I created a list of 5-6 questions for each of the five core meta pillars.\n\n1. Resolving Conflict\n2. Growing Continuously\n3. Embracing Ambiguity\n4. Driving Results\n5. Communicating Effectively\n\nI outlined 10 different work examples. Then I wrote a story for each of the questions based on those work examples. Then I got friends to ask me the same questions over and over again. At first I took too long to answer a question (7 minutes) and I wasn't clear with the STAR technique. After 8-10 rounds of 5 questions, I felt like I had my examples memorized and each took 3 minutes to get all elements of star.\n\nThis took about 1 week. \n\n##### Final Review\nFor the last 2 weeks or so, I practiced interviewing. I did online interviews on Exponent for system design, leetcode, and behavioral. It was really hit or miss who I got on the site. So I stopped after 1 week and just practiced with a friend each day. \n\n#### Interview\n\n1. Behavorial\n\nI got a nice interviewer who asked standard interview questions. Some weren't exactly like the questions I had practiced, but I just picked 1 of the 10 examples I had and fitted it to the question. Interviewer was laughing and said he wanted to see me in the office sometime. \n\n2. System Design\n\nI was thrown off guard because I didn't get one of the questions on the Hello Interview Guides. Note this question was on discussion pages of Hello Interview, but was ranked low.\n\nI thought I could use top-k videos for this problem, but my interviewer said since he only asked me for 1 game that I was going too far. I scaled it back and went more like the leetcode leader board with a Redis sorted set and he was happy. I wanted to try for E5 even though my years put me at E4. I wasn't picked for E5 because I had help.\n\n3. LeetCode I\n\nI got two variants of top 100 meta tagged questions. I highly recommend people review CodingWithMinmer if you have an onsite. It saved me. Both of them were from CodingWithMinmer's channel although slightly different (but not in a meaningful way). The second variant, I didn't remember as well, so I got stuck at the coding, but made it out okay because I had so much time saved from the first question.\n\n4. LeetCode II\n\nI got another two variants. One from CodingWithMinmer and the other was a top meta tagged; but to return the list instead of the size. I finished both in 10 minutes. The only problem was that for the first one I forgot the 0 case because Minmer did only positive numbers. I got so nervous and my brain couldn't think about how to solve it. The interviewer kindly reminded me that I had 30 minutes to solve this one case and to take a breath. She was really nice and that helped me calm down enough to finish the case.\n\n#### Result:\nMy recruiter called me 4 hours after my final interview and said my feedback was really strong. I passed E4, but because for system design I got help, I didn't get E5.\n\n#### Team Matching\nThis was the worst part. I live in NYC and I can't move. NYC is really hard to team match. It took me 5 weeks. I heard nothing for 4 weeks. I joined a Discord of other meta TM candidates to get advice. I saw some people had been waiting months. I heard that a good idea is to message people on Linkedin or get a friend in Meta to ping HMs. I did both. After my friend spammed HMs, I got matched the same day.\n\n#### Negotiation\nI didn't have any other offers from other companies. I was too busy to interview for more places, but my Amazon salary is near the top of my level. My Amazon salary got me probably the highest comp that Meta was offering for E4 right now from what I saw on the discord channel. It is nothing like 2021, but it is higher than Amazon so I took it.\n\nMy NYC Amazon Salary: 190K base/300K RSU for 3 years\nMy NYC Meta: 193k base/450K RSU for 4 years/35K bonus/15% yearly rate bonus\n\n#### Summary\nI used to love my teams at Amazon, which is why I stayed so long. However, things have changed and management has become more toxic as my teams grew. RTO5, salary, and poor treatment of my team is what made me leave. I hope for better treatment from my new team. I hope people also find themselves relating to this too and find that my post gave them courage to fight for what they deserve (to be treated like a human) at work. At the end of the day the hiring process is all about luck. I got lucky to have nice interviewers. Don't be too hard on yourselves as some things are out of our control. I wish everyone else luck on their journeys\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, since I joined straight out of college, my current salary still doesn\u2019t match what I had expected or what the market offers for similar roles.\n\nSo I\u2019ve decided that this might be a good time to explore new opportunities. That said, I\u2019m not just looking for a better salary\u2014I\u2019d also like to join a company that\u2019s actually growing and consistently rewarding its employees with fair appraisals, just like my current one (percentage-wise).\n\nMy question is:\nHow do you evaluate whether a company is truly growing and gives decent appraisals?\nAre there websites or platforms where this information is shared? Or is it something you can only figure out after getting an offer and speaking directly with current employees?\n\nWould really appreciate any insights, tips, or platforms you use to research such info.\n\nThanks in advance!"}

I\u2019ve participated in over 100 interviews across 30+ companies, but without a doubt, the most engaging and fulfilling experience was with **Microsoft**. The entire process felt less like a formal assessment and more like a thoughtful, intellectually stimulating conversation\u2014just like the ones I usually have with my colleagues during problem-solving discussions.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Application Process\n\nI applied through the official [Microsoft Careers](https://careers.microsoft.com/) page. About a week later, I received a call from the HR representative, who walked me through the entire interview process. They clearly outlined the structure:\n\n### Total Rounds: 5\n\n1. Online Codility DSA Round\n2. DSA Interview\n3. System Design Round 1\n4. System Design Round 2\n5. Hiring Manager Round\n\nThe HR also mentioned that the interviews were **partially eliminative**. If I cleared the online assessment, I\u2019d be expected to take the next **three technical rounds on the same day**, with the fourth round contingent on clearing rounds 2 and 3.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Round 1 \u2013 Codility Online DSA Round\n\nThis was a timed coding round hosted on Codility. I received **2 problems**:\n\n* I fully solved one problem, passing all test cases.\n* I was only able to partially solve the second one.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Observations:\n\n* Ensure you solve **at least one problem completely** and make a good attempt on the second.\n\n### \u2705 Result: Cleared the cutoff\n\nReceived a call from the recruiter confirming progression to the next round.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Round 2 \u2013 Data Structures & Algorithms\n\nThis round was a live coding session with an engineer.\n\n* I was asked to solve a **medium-level DSA problem**.\n* I began with a brute-force approach, which I clearly explained.\n* The interviewer nudged me toward optimization. I was able to do it.\n* Then again interviewer asked me to optimise it further which partially I did it but couldn't do it further and interviewer helped me to go through it with full explanation of code.\n\nNext, I was asked a **situational/behavioral question**:\n\n> *\"Tell me about a time when you were discussing an approach with your team, and later realized your suggestion wasn\u2019t the best. How did you handle it?\"*\n\nI structured my response using the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result), and the interviewer seemed satisfied.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Observations:\n\n* Be expressive and communicate your thought process clearly.\n* Start with a brute-force solution quickly, then improve.\n* Prioritize **clean, bug-free code**.\n* Prepare real-life stories for behavioral questions.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Round 3 \u2013 System Design: Design **Airbnb**\n\nThis round focused on **high-level system design**. I used the **RADIO framework**:\n\n1. **R**equirements gathering\n2. **A**rchitecture (High-Level Design)\n3. **D**ata modeling\n4. **I**nterface (API Design)\n5. **O**ptimizations\n\nHowever, the interviewer redirected the discussion to a more specific concurrency problem:\n\n> **\"How would you handle scenarios where multiple users try to book the same room via different platforms?\"**\n\nScenarios discussed:\n\n1. Same room, same platform\n2. Same room, different platforms\n3. Different rooms, same platform\n4. Different rooms, different platforms\n\nPlatforms mentioned: **Airbnb, MakeMyTrip, Booking.com, Agoda**\n\nWe explored each case in detail, discussed component interactions, and designed solutions to handle consistency and concurrency.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Observations:\n\n* Be flexible in your approach\u2014expect the design discussion to evolve.\n* Visualize your solution (block diagrams help!).\n* Understand edge cases, particularly around consistency and race conditions.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Round 4 \u2013 System Design Discussion\n\nThis round was the most conversational and interactive of them all. The interviewer\u2019s enthusiasm made the session truly enjoyable.\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Problem Statement:\n\n> *\"You are given multiple APIs and need to render the data in an infinite scroll list. How would you design it?\"*\n\nAdditionally:\n\n> *\"If a Product Manager presented you with this problem, what follow-up questions would you ask?\"*\n\nI focused on gathering clarity by asking:\n\n1. What kind of data will each API return?\n2. Are the data formats consistent?\n3. Will we need filtering/sorting?\n4. Can the number of APIs vary dynamically?\n5. What should we show if all APIs fail?\n6. How should error messages be handled?\n\nWe explored all scenarios thoroughly, especially around UX and edge case handling.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Observations:\n\n* Strong communication and **asking the right questions** matter.\n* Understand failure cases and user impact.\n* The interviewer was highly experienced (10+ years), and the depth of discussion reflected that.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 Round 5 \u2013 Hiring Manager Round\n\nThis round had two components:\n\n1. A basic **React coding task**\n2. Several **behavioral and situational questions**\n\nThe coding task was simple, but the focus was on:\n\n* **Code readability**\n* **Communication**\n\nThe behavioral questions were based on **real-world scenarios**, most of which I had faced during my career. I answered honestly\u2014even admitting when I hadn\u2019t encountered certain situations.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Observations:\n\n* This round evaluates your **problem-solving approach** and **communication**.\n* Be honest\u2014don\u2019t fabricate experiences.\n* Keep your stories authentic and professional.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Verdict: **Selected**\n\nI received the offer letter **one week later**. \ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac What I Loved About the Experience:\n\n* Interviewers were **highly engaging**, knowledgeable, and respectful.\n* Conversations felt collaborative rather than evaluative.\n* I was encouraged to think deeply and communicate effectively.\n\n---\n\n## \u2728 Key Takeaways\n\n* Microsoft emphasizes **clarity of thought, structured problem-solving**, and **collaborative communication**.\n* System design isn\u2019t just about architecture\u2014it\u2019s about understanding real-world complexity and user scenarios.\n* Behavioral questions matter as much as technical ones.\n* Being genuine and prepared makes a significant difference.\n\n---\n\nIf you're preparing for Microsoft or any top-tier company, I hope this detailed breakdown helps you navigate the journey better. Let me know if you want me to write a technical breakdown of any specific round!\n\n"}

If you are 0-2 years experience and you don't have much better options then you can consider joining bcz it pays (16-17 Lakh INR CTC) well in 0-2 years of experience and also for freshers it should be OK to start your carrer with but keep in mind side by side you should continue learning extra stuffs bcz here nowdays they are not dealing with any latest updated tech stuffs or anything so you have to move out once you complete junior level experience.\n\n2. if you are 3+ YOE Avoid Joining or give it least priority or try for better.\n\n3. if in case you have 3+ YOE and the HR are able to come to a fair mutual aggrement be it your **compensation** or **WLB** or anything else according to your Priority you can consider joining and can plan to stay within the organization for Sometime but i would suggest don't plan to stay here for more than 1-2 years if you are Joining at 3+ YOE.\n\n4. WLB is not great as well as not that Bad overall WLB is okayish 60-70% People Stay till late night in the office.\n\n5. HR will play lot of tricks to lowball you, just deny them diplomatically if they are not meeting your expectations. one of my friend did the same and last 12 days of notice period from his current organization my friend informed Sanvine that i got better offer almost 90% hike from my current salary which is close to 28 LPA Base and i will not be joining, then HR started saying lot of things you will have good exposure , learning opportunity bla bla bla.... finally he refused sandvine and joined with the new offer.\n\n\n6. Problem is that: only the senior most people who are not capable enough and are here for more than 10 years are withdrawing huge salary and for mid level engineers (3+ YOE) they are looking for good candidates who can actually work hard but at the cost of pennies.\n\n\n```\nconclusion: give it least priority...\n```\n\nif you are a above average Software Engineer and making a switch you can expect the below salary in the market which would be a fair according to 2025 Standards. Standards may differ if you are watching this post after 2025.\n\n3-4 Years: BASE: 24-30 LPA\n4-7 Years: BASE: 32 - 48 LPA\n\n\n\n"}

Even at SDE-1, interviewers want to see *thoughtful trade-offs* and *clear architecture thinking*. Avoiding these common pitfalls can dramatically improve your chances.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 1. Skipping Requirement Clarification\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Jumping straight into drawing diagrams.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** You might build the wrong system.\r\n* **Fix:** Spend 2\u20133 minutes confirming functional (throughput, latency) and non\u2010functional (SLAs, scale) requirements. Ask questions like:\r\n\r\n  * \u201cWhat\u2019s our target QPS?\u201d\r\n  * \u201cHow consistent must reads be?\u201d\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Over-Engineering from the Start\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Designing full microservices before tackling basics.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** You\u2019ll run out of time and confuse the interviewer.\r\n* **Fix:** First propose a **simple monolith** or single\u2010service solution. Then iterate:\r\n\r\n  1. Single API server + relational DB\r\n  2. Add caching layer\r\n  3. Introduce partitioning or sharding\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 3. Neglecting Data Modeling\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Ignoring how data is stored\u2014jumping straight to load balancers.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** You can\u2019t discuss partition keys or index strategies later.\r\n* **Fix:** Sketch your database schema early. Discuss:\r\n\r\n  * Table design (primary keys, foreign keys)\r\n  * Indexes vs. full\u2010text search\r\n  * SQL vs. NoSQL trade-offs\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 4. Failing to Address Failure Modes\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Assuming every component is 100% available.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** Real systems fail; you need resilience.\r\n* **Fix:** For each component, ask \u201cWhat if it fails?\u201d Then propose:\r\n\r\n  * Circuit breakers\r\n  * Retry policies with exponential backoff\r\n  * Dead-letter queues\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 5. Ignoring Security & Privacy\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Leaving out authentication, authorization, or data encryption.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** Security is non-negotiable in interviews and production.\r\n* **Fix:** Explicitly call out:\r\n\r\n  * OAuth or token\u2010based auth flow\r\n  * TLS for data in transit\r\n  * Encryption at rest\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 6. Overlooking Monitoring & Metrics\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Finishing the design without thinking about observability.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** You can\u2019t ensure SLAs without monitoring.\r\n* **Fix:** Propose metrics and dashboards:\r\n\r\n  * QPS, latency percentiles (p95/p99)\r\n  * Error rates, number of timeouts\r\n  * Health checks and alerting\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 7. Rushing Through Caching Strategies\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Saying \u201cwe\u2019ll cache\u201d without specifying patterns.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** Interviewers want depth on cache invalidation, cache stampede.\r\n* **Fix:** Describe:\r\n\r\n  * Cache-aside vs. write-through vs. write-back\r\n  * Expiration policies (TTL, LRU)\r\n  * Stampede protection (mutex, request coalescing)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 8. Forgetting Data Consistency Models\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Assuming strong consistency everywhere.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** You might block high-throughput use cases unnecessarily.\r\n* **Fix:** Discuss consistency trade-offs:\r\n\r\n  * Strong vs. eventual consistency\r\n  * When read-your-writes or monotonic reads matter\r\n  * Use cases for quorum reads/writes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 9. Not Time-Boxing Your Discussion\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Spending the entire time on one component.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** You might never cover scaling, monitoring, or failover.\r\n* **Fix:** Allocate rough time:\r\n\r\n  * 5 min requirements\r\n  * 10 min high-level design\r\n  * 10 min deep dive (pick one component)\r\n  * 5 min scaling, monitoring, wrap-up\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 10. Skipping Trade-Off Conversations\r\n\r\n* **Mistake:** Presenting a single \u201cperfect\u201d solution.\r\n* **Why It\u2019s Bad:** Interviewers want to see how you evaluate options.\r\n* **Fix:** For each key decision, explicitly compare alternatives:\r\n\r\n  * SQL vs. NoSQL: latency vs. consistency\r\n  * Monolith vs. microservices: simplicity vs. maintainability\r\n  * CDN vs. origin server: cost vs. performance\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Final Tips\r\n\r\n* **Practice End-to-End:** Design a service start to finish in 20 minutes on a whiteboard or Excalidraw.\r\n* **Get Feedback:** Record your mock interviews and note missing sections.\r\n* **Stay Conversational:** Talk through assumptions and trade-offs as you draw.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

One thing to know about Google interviews: they often keep questions **vague on purpose**. Not to confuse you, but to observe how well you communicate, how you break down problems, and how deeply you think.\r\n\r\n> \ud83d\udccc **Golden Rule for Google Interviews**:\r\n>\r\n> * Read the problem multiple times.\r\n> * Ask clarifying questions.\r\n> * Don\u2019t rush into coding.\r\n> * They want clean, well-thought-out solutions \u2014 not quick fixes.\r\n\r\nMy **telephonic round** had **two tree-based questions**:\r\n\r\n* One was centered on **Inorder Traversal**.\r\n* The other seemed like a follow-up, but turned out to be **completely independent** \u2014 testing if I could recognize the difference and *push back if needed*.\r\n  I proposed **alternate and optimized solutions** to both \u2014 and that helped me stand out.\r\n\r\nA week later, I got a call from HR: **I passed!** They asked for my availability for onsite interviews \u2014 five potential days. I agreed. My interviews were scheduled on **four consecutive days**, which was incredibly stressful.\r\n\r\nIn the **week leading up**, I was grinding hard on everything I ever struggled with:\r\n**KMP**, **Convex Hull**, **Segment Trees**, and more. I was mentally exhausted, constantly questioning if I\u2019d even make it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Onsite Round 1**\r\n\r\nA **two-pointer problem** with **precomputation**, related to **subarray sums**.\r\n\r\n### **Onsite Round 2**\r\n\r\nA **recursive tree problem** involving **contiguous and isolated identical values**.\r\n\r\n### **Onsite Round 3**\r\n\r\nThe interviewer didn\u2019t show up, so it got **postponed a week**.\r\nWhen it finally happened, it was a **stack-based question** involving **bracket matching** and **equation simplification**.\r\n\r\n### **Googliness Round**\r\n\r\nFocused on **behavioral aspects** \u2014 leadership, pressure handling, communication, and ethics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAll these rounds, back to back, were **mentally draining**. I had **panic attacks**. At one point, I was literally **crying and breathless during the interview**, but somehow \u2014 I **held it together**.\r\n\r\nI cleared **3 out of 4** rounds. The one I missed? The one where anxiety truly got the best of me.\r\n\r\nStill, HR told me that passing **2 was enough**, and I\u2019d done really well \u2014 so they pushed me forward. I went through **team matching** and everything was going well... until it wasn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nHiring Committee **backed out** , probably concerned about the one failed round, scheduled **2 more DSA interviews** to be safe \ud83d\ude43.\r\n\r\nThen began a **2-month delay** full of reschedules and uncertainty.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Onsite Round 4**\r\n\r\nAn **array-based** problem involving **greedy strategy**, **prefix sums**, and **hashmap balancing**.\r\nIt felt like solving a complex **necklace arrangement** problem \u2014 but the question was **poorly worded**, and the test cases were brutal. I was on the edge the whole time.\r\n\r\n### **Onsite Round 5**\r\n\r\nThankfully, this was a **Leetcode contest problem** I\u2019d solved 2 months ago and was daily problem a week ago \ud83d\ude09. The follow-up was the same, but seeing me solve quickly, the interviewer got suspicious and gave me a **third follow-up**.\r\nLuckily, I had my **heap**, **two-pointer**, and **binary search** strategies ready \u2014 and nailed it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter those two final rounds, I felt hopeful but also scared.\r\n*What if they think I cheated?*\r\n*What if they drop me now?*\r\nI had worked too hard and come too far.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is \u2014 the real game is in how you **communicate**.\r\nHow you shape the problem, how you ask the right questions, how you structure your thoughts.\r\n\r\nThere were moments I was running out of time, but because my **approach was solid** and I picked the **right data structures**, I was given a pass.\r\n\r\nA **week later**, HR called:\r\n\r\n> \u201cIt\u2019s all positive! \u2026But your matched team has moved on.\u201d\r\n\r\nBack to **team-matching** \u2014 again.\r\n\r\nTwo more weeks. Two more screenings.\r\nFinally\u2026 **I found my team.**\r\n\r\nIn the next part, I\u2019ll share how the salary negotiation unfolded, along with the perks, benefits, and everything else that came with the offer \u2014 stay tuned!\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Answer to comments **\r\n1.

I started watching DSA videos in 11th grade and kicked off my LeetCode journey around 3 years ago. That shiny streak? Still going strong \ud83d\udcaa\r\n\r\nA lot happened in October last year. One of my favorite musicians passed away, my mental health took a major hit, and in the middle of all that, I got *the email*. Google HR reached out saying they wanted to interview me. No referral. Just me, constantly applying and praying my resume made it to the top of the pile. (Tip: BOLD the important stuff in your resume \u2014 HRs don\u2019t have time, and first impressions matter!)\r\n\r\nBut I wasn\u2019t in the best place. Emotionally drained, full of anxiety, I couldn\u2019t even process it properly. And guess what? I got kicked out right after HR screening \u2014 turns out, my current tech stack didn\u2019t align with their needs. Then... the HR ghosted me.\r\n\r\nI was devastated. Thought I got put on a cool-down period. Helpless, I started reaching out to everyone I could. Sent tons of connection requests, begged for referrals. Only one person responded \u2014 based purely on my LeetCode profile. That meant the world. I\u2019ve spent over 3 years grinding here, and it finally counted.\r\n\r\nStill job-hunting, still doubting myself, I got another email from a different Google HR. Same message. A new chance. Meanwhile, I\u2019d already failed over 10 interviews \u2014 Juspay, NammaYatri, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, and more. I realized I lacked in development skills \u2014 I had given everything to DSA.\r\n\r\nBut this time, I was ready. My failures taught me how to speak. How to express. This was my *second shot* at a better life.\r\n\r\nMy current job wasn\u2019t helping either. Office politics were the worst. My manager kept exploiting my work, taking credit, and during my yearly feedback, had the nerve to say *I\u2019m useless without him.*\r\n\r\nBut guess what?\r\n\r\nIn the next post, I\u2019ll break down all my interview rounds and in the last one \u2014 my salary negotiation and final result.\r\n\r\n**Spoilers: I\u2019M IN.

Hopefully this helps anyone on the fence about how to tackle that dreaded 90-minute timer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## The Setup\r\n\r\n* **Duration:** 90 minutes\r\n* **Environment:** HackerRank-style editor, no external libraries\r\n* **Problems:**\r\n\r\n  1. **Medium:** Merge k Sorted Lists\r\n  2. **Hard:** Word Ladder II\r\n  3. **Medium:** Count of Smaller Numbers After Self\r\n\r\nI paced myself about **30 minutes per problem**, leaving a few minutes at the end of each for quick review.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 1\ufe0f Problem 1: Merge k Sorted Lists (Medium)\r\n\r\n**Prompt (summarized):**\r\nYou have `k` linked lists, each sorted ascending. Merge them into one sorted list and return its head.\r\n\r\n**My Approach:**\r\n\r\n* Use a **min-heap** keyed by node value.\r\n* Push the head of each non-empty list into the heap.\r\n* Repeatedly pop the smallest node, append it to the result, and if that node has a `next`, push `next` into the heap.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport heapq\r\n\r\ndef mergeKLists(lists):\r\n    heap = []\r\n    for idx, node in enumerate(lists):\r\n        if node:\r\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.val, idx, node))\r\n    dummy = ListNode(0)\r\n    tail = dummy\r\n\r\n    while heap:\r\n        val, idx, node = heapq.heappop(heap)\r\n        tail.next = node\r\n        tail = tail.next\r\n        if node.next:\r\n            heapq.heappush(heap, (node.next.val, idx, node.next))\r\n\r\n    return dummy.next\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Edge Cases & Lessons:**\r\n\r\n* **Identical values:** I included `idx` in the heap tuple to avoid tie issues.\r\n* **Empty input list:** Checked `if node` before pushing.\r\n\r\n*Could\u2019ve been 3\u20134 minutes faster by pre-allocating the dummy and skipping the tuple index, but safe is better under pressure.*\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 2\ufe0f Problem 2: Word Ladder II (Hard)\r\n\r\n**Prompt (summarized):**\r\nGiven `beginWord`, `endWord`, and a `wordList`, return all shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord`. Each step must change one letter and land in `wordList`.\r\n\r\n**My Approach:**\r\n\r\n1. **BFS** to build a graph of shortest-level connections.\r\n2. **DFS/backtracking** from `beginWord` to `endWord`, following only edges that move to the next level.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\r\n\r\ndef findLadders(begin, end, wordList):\r\n    wordSet = set(wordList)\r\n    if end not in wordSet:\r\n        return []\r\n\r\n    # Build adjacency by BFS levels\r\n    levels = {begin: 0}\r\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\r\n    queue = deque([begin])\r\n\r\n    while queue:\r\n        word = queue.popleft()\r\n        for i in range(len(word)):\r\n            for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\r\n                nxt = word[:i] + c + word[i+1:]\r\n                if nxt in wordSet:\r\n                    if nxt not in levels:\r\n                        levels[nxt] = levels[word] + 1\r\n                        queue.append(nxt)\r\n                    if levels[nxt] == levels[word] + 1:\r\n                        graph[word].append(nxt)\r\n\r\n    # Backtrack all shortest paths\r\n    res = []\r\n    def dfs(path):\r\n        if path[-1] == end:\r\n            res.append(path[:])\r\n            return\r\n        for nxt in graph[path[-1]]:\r\n            dfs(path + [nxt])\r\n\r\n    dfs([begin])\r\n    return res\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What I\u2019d improve:**\r\n\r\n* I got **TLE on large inputs** because I regenerated all 26-letter possibilities each time. Pre-computing generic patterns (`h*t`, `ho*`, etc.) would be faster.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3\ufe0f Problem 3: Count of Smaller Numbers After Self (Medium)\r\n\r\n**Prompt (summarized):**\r\nFor each element in `nums`, count how many elements to its right are smaller. Return the list of counts.\r\n\r\n**My Approach:**\r\n\r\n* Used a **Fenwick Tree** (Binary Indexed Tree) on the **compressed ranks** of the values.\r\n* Traverse from right to left, query the BIT for how many have rank `< current rank`, then update the BIT at current rank.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef countSmaller(nums):\r\n    # Coordinate compression\r\n    sorted_unique = sorted(set(nums))\r\n    rank = {v: i+1 for i, v in enumerate(sorted_unique)}\r\n    size = len(sorted_unique)\r\n    BIT = [0] * (size + 1)\r\n\r\n    def update(i):\r\n        while i <= size:\r\n            BIT[i] += 1\r\n            i += i & -i\r\n\r\n    def query(i):\r\n        s = 0\r\n        while i > 0:\r\n            s += BIT[i]\r\n            i -= i & -i\r\n        return s\r\n\r\n    res = []\r\n    for x in reversed(nums):\r\n        r = rank[x]\r\n        res.append(query(r - 1))\r\n        update(r)\r\n    return res[::-1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Key Points:**\r\n\r\n* **Compression** handles negatives/large values.\r\n* Fenwick guarantees **O(n log n)**.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##  What I\u2019d Do Differently\r\n\r\n1. **Time allocation:** I spent 35 min on Word Ladder II and got TLE. Next time, I\u2019d allocate only 25 min to it and move on.\r\n2. **Edge-case checklist:** I missed testing `[]` and single-element inputs on the first problem\u2014would write simple asserts before coding.\r\n3. **Quick skimming:** I\u2019d note \u201cconstraints: `wordList` up to 5 k words\u201d and opt for pattern-based adjacency pre-compute immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}

But I am not in a position to relocate. I still have one year if I change my mind.\n\n\n**Rejections:** Stripe and Google\nGoogle, I felt I was a bit unlucky. Got an interviewer who was least interested in the interview and didnt seem like one who wanted the candidate to succeed. He ended up giving a Strong No hire. \nAs for Stripe, no complaints here, I seriously messed up one of my rounds and knew I will be rejected. \n\n\n**Views on the market**: The market is tough right now \u2014 even one weak round can lead to rejection or down-leveling. That being said, good prep still goes a long way. Roles are fewer, but companies continue to hire top talent.\n\n**Tips and strategies**: \nOne notable shift I observed was the reduced emphasis on traditional LeetCode-style problems. For example, companies like Samsara and Stripe didn\u2019t include any such rounds. The focus has moved towards medium-level coding problems with more weight on how you approach the problem, your code structure, modularity, edge case handling, and overall discussion. Only Meta and Google still stick to hardcore LC-style questions.\n\nFor System Design, senior roles now expect staff-level depth. And don\u2019t ignore the behavioral rounds \u2014 they\u2019re critical. A weak showing here can lead to down-leveling, regardless of technical performance."}

Along the way, I\u2019ve talked to friends who\u2019ve scored jobs at places like Amazon, Apple, and smaller startups, and I\u2019ve had my fair share of \u201cugh, why didn\u2019t I see that?\u201d moments. If you\u2019re feeling swamped by LeetCode or wondering how to prep without turning into a coding zombie, I\u2019ve got you covered. Here\u2019s a straightforward guide to making LeetCode your ally, not your enemy, written like we\u2019re just chatting over a burger.\r\n\r\n## Why LeetCode Matters (But Isn\u2019t Your Entire Life)\r\n\r\nLeetCode is a big piece of the puzzle for software engineering interviews, especially at product-based companies like Google or Meta. It\u2019s not just about banging out code\u2014it\u2019s about showing you can untangle a problem, think clearly, and write something that works without a million bugs, even when you\u2019re nervous. But here\u2019s the deal: LeetCode is only part of the picture. Companies also want to see your projects, hear how you work with others, and know you\u2019re not just a code machine. So, let\u2019s talk about how to prep efficiently and still have time for, you know, life.\r\n\r\n## My Key Takeaways for LeetCode Success\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from my own grind, plus some wisdom from friends who\u2019ve been through the interview gauntlet:\r\n\r\n1. **Go for Depth, Not Just Numbers**  \r\n   When I started, I thought I had to solve 400 problems to be \u201cready.\u201d Turns out, that\u2019s a recipe for burnout. After about 120 problems, I was mostly redoing the same ideas in different flavors.  \r\n   - Aim for 60\u201380 well-chosen problems that cover the essentials: arrays, strings, linked lists, binary trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and two-pointer techniques.  \r\n   - Stick to medium problems\u2014they\u2019re the bread and butter of most interviews. Add a handful of hards if you\u2019re aiming for FAANG or similar.  \r\n   - Check out LeetCode\u2019s \u201cTop 100 Liked Questions\u201d or filter by company (like \u201cMicrosoft\u201d or \u201cAdobe\u201d) to focus on what\u2019s relevant.\r\n\r\n2. **Get the Logic, Don\u2019t Just Copy-Paste**  \r\n   Early on, I\u2019d get stuck and rush to the solution tab, thinking I\u2019d magically \u201cget it.\u201d Big nope. You need to wrestle with the problem to actually learn.  \r\n   - Give yourself 15\u201320 minutes to think before peeking at hints. Ask: What\u2019s the input? What\u2019s the output? Can I solve it the slow way first?  \r\n   - Jot down your thoughts\u2014on paper, a whiteboard, or even a random napkin. It\u2019s crazy how much clearer things get when you map it out.  \r\n   - After solving, hit up the discussion tab. You\u2019ll find clever tricks or edge cases you didn\u2019t consider.\r\n\r\n3. **Prep for the Interviewer\u2019s Follow-Ups**  \r\n   Interviewers love to spice things up with questions like, \u201cCan you optimize this?\u201d or \u201cWhat if the input is a million rows?\u201d You\u2019ve got to be ready to adapt.  \r\n   - Practice explaining your solution\u2019s time and space complexity in simple terms, like you\u2019re telling a friend.  \r\n   - Know how to shift from a clunky brute-force approach to something leaner, like using a hash set instead of a double loop.  \r\n   - Learn patterns like sliding windows, DFS/BFS, or binary search\u2014they\u2019re like shortcuts that unlock tons of problems.\r\n\r\n4. **Practice Like It\u2019s the Real Deal**  \r\n   LeetCode\u2019s timer is a great way to mimic interview pressure. Set a 30\u201345-minute limit per problem to get used to thinking on your feet.  \r\n   - Try mock interviews on platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io. It\u2019s awkward at first, but it\u2019s gold for building confidence.  \r\n   - Talk through your solution out loud, even if it\u2019s just to your cat. It\u2019ll make explaining your thought process in interviews feel natural.\r\n\r\n5. **Keep Track of Your Progress**  \r\n   I started a simple Google Sheet to log my problems: topic, difficulty, link to my solution, and \u201cwhat I screwed up.\u201d It\u2019s like a personal coach for spotting weak spots.  \r\n   - Revisit problems you struggled with every couple of weeks. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much easier they feel.  \r\n   - Take a second to pat yourself on the back when you nail a tough one\u2014it keeps the motivation up.\r\n\r\n## Bonus Tips to Shine Bright\r\n\r\n- Build one solid project with clean code and a nice README. It can impress recruiters more than a high LeetCode streak.  \r\n- Reach out for referrals. A quick LinkedIn message to someone at the company can get your resume to the top of the pile.  \r\n- Don\u2019t sleep on behavioral interviews. Prep stories for questions like \u201cTell me about a time you failed\u201d to show you\u2019re human and learn from mistakes.  \r\n- If LeetCode\u2019s sucking your soul, take a break and study system design or CS fundamentals. Variety keeps you sane.\r\n\r\n## Your Starter Plan\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re wondering where to begin, here\u2019s a quick roadmap:  \r\n- **Week 1**: Knock out 10\u201315 easy problems to get comfortable. Focus on arrays and strings.  \r\n- **Weeks 2\u20133**: Tackle 25\u201330 mediums across graphs, trees, and dynamic programming. Learn one new pattern, like two-pointers.  \r\n- **Week 4**: Try 5\u201310 hards and revisit your toughest problems. Do a mock interview with a friend.  \r\n- **Keep it going**: Solve 2\u20133 problems a day, explain one solution out loud, and polish your portfolio.\r\n\r\n## My Thoughts\r\n\r\nLeetCode isn\u2019t about being a coding wizard\u2014it\u2019s about showing you can solve problems, write solid code, and keep your cool. You don\u2019t need to be perfect; you just need to be prepared. Every problem you crack is a step closer to that \u201cYou\u2019re hired!\u201d email. Stay consistent, don\u2019t beat yourself up over mistakes, and you\u2019ll get there.\r\n\r\n"}

I've included both recursive and iterative (BFS) approaches.\n\nProblem Summary:\nGiven a binary tree, return its minimum depth, i.e., the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node to the nearest leaf node.\n\nIntuition\nThe minimum depth must go all the way to a leaf (a node with no children).\nWe can't just pick the smaller subtree \u2014 we must ignore null paths unless the node is a leaf.\n\nApproach 1: Recursive DFS\nKey Ideas:\nIf the current node is null, return 0.\n\nIf only one child is null, take the depth from the other child.\n\nIf both children exist, take the minimum depth between them.\nCode:\njavascript\nvar minDepth = function(root) {\n    if (!root) return 0;\n\n    if (!root.left) return 1 + minDepth(root.right);\n    if (!root.right) return 1 + minDepth(root.left);\n\n    return 1 + Math.min(minDepth(root.left), minDepth(root.right));\n};\nApproach 2: Iterative BFS (Best for Large Trees)\nWhy BFS?\nAs soon as we find the first leaf, we return \u2014 that\u2019s the minimum depth.\n\nIt\u2019s faster in practice for wide or unbalanced trees.\n\nCode:\njavascript\nvar minDepth = function(root) {\n    if (!root) return 0;\n\n    const queue = [{ node: root, depth: 1 }];\n\n    while (queue.length) {\n        const { node, depth } = queue.shift();\n\n        // If it's a leaf, return its depth\n        if (!node.left && !node.right) return depth;\n\n        if (node.left) queue.push({ node: node.left, depth: depth + 1 });\n        if (node.right) queue.push({ node: node.right, depth: depth + 1 });\n    }\n};\nTime and Space Complexity\n\nApproach\tTime Complexity\tSpace Complexity\nRecursive DFS\tO(n)\tO(h) (call stack)\nIterative BFS\tO(n)\tO(n) (queue)\nn = number of nodes\n\nh = height of the tree\n\nFinal Notes\nAlways check for null paths in recursion \u2014 don't accidentally take Math.min(null, depth).\n\nFor large or skewed trees, BFS may be more efficient.\n\n"}

I responded honestly, saying that as a candidate, I\u2019d obviously aim higher, so I quoted \u20b940 LPA. It might seem unrealistic to some, but from my perspective, here\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s justified:\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been solving LeetCode problems daily for the past year, without missing a single day.\r\n\r\nI completed an expensive system design course (you can guess which one xD) to strengthen my architecture skills.\r\n\r\nDue to my contributions at work, I was promoted to Senior SDE within a year.\r\n\r\nI believe my lower current CTC is primarily because I started my career with lower pay, not because of a lack of skill or value.\r\n\r\nThe recruiter asked, \"Considering your skill set, how are you sure about expecting 40 LPA?\"\r\n\r\nIn my mind, I thought \u2014 this is just the first HR call; shouldn\u2019t technical assessments come next?\r\n\r\nI asked for clarification: \u201cAre you referring to my resume or something else?\u201d\r\nHe replied, \u201cI\u2019m talking about your resume and your communication skills.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt that point, I didn\u2019t really have a comeback about communication skills \u2014 I had nothing to say.\r\n\r\nHe also mentioned, \"Just because the role title matches your current designation doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a fit for the role.\"\r\n\r\nThe role required experience with Django, which I haven\u2019t worked with directly. However, I do have experience with Spring Boot and Node.js, and I don\u2019t believe Django would be a big leap. I said I could pick it up in a month.\r\n\r\nHe responded, \u201cWe have people with 10 years of experience working on Django. And you think you can learn it in one month?\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter that, for every response, he kept saying, \"I am not convinced with your answer.\"\r\n\r\nI still think I can get a better opportunity than this, but I felt he got aggressive during the call, which wasn\u2019t necessary.\r\n\r\n"}

If both arrive at the same time, we return 0. Otherwise, we return 1 for Person 1 or 2 for Person 2, depending on who arrives first.\r\n\r\nApproach:\r\nThe problem is quite simple and involves calculating the absolute distance from each person to Person 3 and comparing those distances.\r\n\r\nCalculate the Distance: We can calculate the distance from Person 1 to Person 3 as abs(x - z), and similarly, calculate the distance for Person 2 with abs(y - z).\r\n\r\nComparison:\r\n\r\nIf the distance for Person 1 is smaller than that of Person 2, return 1 (meaning Person 1 reaches first).\r\n\r\nIf the distance for Person 2 is smaller than that of Person 1, return 2.\r\n\r\nIf both distances are the same, return 0 (indicating they reach at the same time).\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures an O(1) time complexity, as we only need to perform a few constant-time operations.\r\n\r\nCode Implementation:\r\nclass Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    int findClosest(int x, int y, int z) {\r\n        int dist1 = abs(x - z); // Distance from Person 1 to Person 3\r\n        int dist2 = abs(y - z); // Distance from Person 2 to Person 3\r\n        \r\n        if (dist1 < dist2) return 1;      // Person 1 reaches first\r\n        else if (dist2 < dist1) return 2; // Person 2 reaches first\r\n        else return 0;                   // Both reach at the same time\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nTime Complexity:\r\nThe time complexity of the solution is O(1) because we are performing constant-time operations (absolute difference and comparisons).\r\n\r\nSpace Complexity:\r\nThe space complexity is O(1) as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space to store distances.\r\n\r\nQuote: \"The simplest solutions are often the most effective ones.\"\r\nLink: LeetCode Problem 3516 - Find Closest Person\r\n\r\nEdge Cases:\r\nBoth at the Same Distance:\r\n\r\nExample: x = 1, y = 5, z = 3\r\n\r\nIn this case, both Person 1 and Person 2 are at the same distance from Person 3, so the result should be 0.\r\n\r\nOne Person Already at the Position:\r\n\r\nExample: x = 2, y = 5, z = 5\r\n\r\nHere, Person 2 is already at position z, and Person 1 has to move.

Whether it\u2019s fixing bugs at 2 AM (we\u2019ve all been there \ud83d\ude05), figuring out why an algorithm won\u2019t work, or just trying to make our code run faster than a sleepy turtle, every day feels like a new puzzle. And honestly? Sometimes it\u2019s so frustrating I wanna throw my laptop out the window. But then\u2026 that \u201cAha!\u201d moment hits, and it\u2019s the BEST feeling ever.\r\n\r\nBut here\u2019s my thought: why struggle alone? I mean, even Batman had Robin, right? Let\u2019s turn this thread into a chill space where we can share tips, rant about problems, and maybe even laugh at our coding fails.\r\n\r\n### Here\u2019s what I\u2019d love to chat about:\r\n\r\nDebugging Drama: Ever spent hours on a bug only to realize it was a missing semicolon? \ud83d\ude2d Share your most facepalm-worthy debugging stories!\r\n\r\n## Algorithm Anxiety: \r\nHow do you even start with problems like \u201cReverse the Quantum Flux in a Linked List Matrix\u201d? Do you scribble diagrams? Cry first? Tell me your secrets!\r\n\r\n## **Optimization Struggles:**\r\n That moment when your code works\u2026 but takes 10 years to run. How do you speed things up? Any cool shortcuts?\r\n\r\n## Brain Freeze: \r\nWhat do you do when you\u2019re super stuck? Watch cat videos? Take a walk? Beg your rubber duck for help?\r\n\r\n## Collab Wins: \r\nEver solved a problem by teaming up with someone? Let\u2019s hear those \u201cwe did it!\u201d stories!\r\n\r\nMy Confession: Last week, I spent 3 days on a problem, only to realize I\u2019d misread the question. Three. Days. \ud83d\ude43 (Pro tip: Read the question 5 times. Then 5 more.)\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s Help Each Other Out!\r\nDrop your:\r\n\r\nTips & Tricks (like how to use print statements without losing your mind)\r\n\r\nGo-To Resources (YouTube channels, blogs, or that one friend who gets recursion)\r\n\r\nCurrent Challenges (maybe someone here has cracked it!)\r\n\r\nFunny/Motivational Stories (because we all need a laugh after 10 wrong submissions)\r\n\r\nRemember, no question is \u201cdumb\u201d here! We\u2019re all learning. And hey, if you\u2019re shy, just lurk\u2014but I promise, jumping in is worth it.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s turn this into the friendliest coding corner on LeetCode! \ud83d\ude80\r\nP.S.

Started with questions about my current work and personal projects.\r\n2. Moved to backend concepts:\r\n    * Explained HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.\r\n    * Asked to write controller logic on the whiteboard (syntax wasn\u2019t the focus \u2014 clarity, structure, and problem approach were key).\r\n    * Questions around MVC architecture, database integration, API flows, and route-controller design.\r\n    * Asked about async/await, what happens without using await, and handling asynchronous flows.\r\n\r\n* Also touched on personal project implementation details.\r\n\r\n#### \u2705 Cleared the round and moved to the second.\r\n\r\n# \ud83e\udde0 Round 2: Design-Oriented Technical Interview\r\n##### This round leaned more towards design and architecture thinking:\r\n1. I was given a system to design and asked how I\u2019d break it down.\r\n2. I mentioned that while I\u2019m still learning system design in depth, I have a high-level understanding of tech stack planning and component breakdown.\r\n3. We discussed backend design using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.\r\n4. Some follow-up questions on hashing and file comparison came up too.\r\n\r\n#### \u2705 Cleared this round as well.\r\n\r\n# \ud83e\udde0 Round 3: Hiring Manager Round\r\n##### This was a mix of technical depth and behavioral assessment:\r\n\r\n1. Walked through my current organization work and personal projects.\r\n2. React-related technical questions with follow-ups.\r\n3. Switched to backend: scenario-based questions on performance and optimization.\r\n4. Assessed problem-solving and communication skills through follow-up challenges.\r\n5. Ended with behavioral and situational questions.\r\n6. He also shared Nike\u2019s team ethics and culture before wrapping up.\r\n\r\n#### And finally\u2026 \u2705 Got selected after the 3rd round, officially starting my journey as an SWE I at Nike."}

Now its not like your regular contest. In almost all questions you won't be given all details and they expect us to get all the clarity and details by asking questions to them. So there will some time invested for this thing too.\n\nI also faced a situation for the Rain water trapping question the Bar-raiser asked it in last 25mins. He didn't even paste the problem statement, he just pasted an array and gave some vague statement via mouth without even the expected answer.

She decided to prepare a goodbye present for her *n* students and give each of them a jigsaw puzzle (which, as Wikipedia states, is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, often oddly shaped, interlocking, and tessellating pieces).\r\n\r\nThe shop assistant told the teacher that there are *m* puzzles in the shop, but they might differ in difficulty and size. Specifically, the first jigsaw puzzle consists of *f1* pieces, the second one consists of *f2* pieces, and so on.\r\n\r\nMs. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents must be as small as possible. Let *A* be the number of pieces in the largest puzzle that the teacher buys, and *B* be the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. She wants to choose *n* puzzles such that *A \u2212 B* is as small as possible. Help the teacher and find the least possible value of *A \u2212 B*.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Input:**\r\n\r\n- The first line contains space-separated integers *n* and *m* (2 \u2264 *n* \u2264 *m* \u2264 50).  \r\n- The second line contains *m* space-separated integers *f1, f2, ..., fm* (4 \u2264 *fi* \u2264 1000) \u2014 the quantities of pieces in the puzzles sold in the shop.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Output:**\r\n\r\n- Print a single integer \u2014 the least possible difference the teacher can obtain.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Example:**\r\n\r\n#### **Input:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n4 6\r\n10 12 10 7 5 22\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **Output:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n5\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### **Explanation:**\r\n\r\nThe class has 4 students. The shop sells 6 puzzles. If Ms. Manana buys the first four puzzles consisting of 10, 12, 10, and 7 pieces correspondingly, then the difference between the sizes of the largest and the smallest puzzle will be equal to 5. It is impossible to obtain a smaller difference. Note that the teacher can also buy puzzles 1, 3, 4, and 5 to obtain the difference 5.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Private Contest:**\r\n\r\nThis problem is part of a private coding contest, designed to test your problem-solving skills in C.

An initial resume screen is performed by the recruiters and then final shorlist is done by Managers who look for good overlap in technical skills of the candidate and skills required for the role.\nSo it's really important to tailor the resume to the Job description for Apple.\n\nApplied to about 10+ roles on the Apple Careers site, whose description overlapped with my experience.\n\n---\n\n### Recruiter Call\nAbout a month later, a recruiter reached out regarding one of the roles. This was for a Full Stack Engineer on an internal ML platform.\nShared my experience and was able to move ahead for a Hiring Manager Round.\n\n---\n\n### Hiring Manager\nA very candid discussion on why I chose the role, my relevant experience, why I would like to join, where I see myself, and why I chose Apple.\nThe conversation was very positive, and I knew I was moving to the next round\n\n\n---\n\n\nTechnical rounds have a general similarity.\nThe problems were highly vague. They required me to ask the right questions to complete the problem definition and then start working on it.\nThey were very keen on clear communication and discussions.\n\n\n### Technical Phone Screen\n**Problem 1:** A vote counter\nStarted with this vague problem statement and narrowed it down to this -\nBuild a class to read millions of votes from a ballot list and perform rank-based vote counting. Had to handle batching to solve for memory usage.\n\n**Problem 2:** Given a Binary tree of 0's and 1's where the left node is the same as the parent and the right node is opposite to the parent, determine the value of the n'th node at l'th level.\nI sketched out a sample tree and then proceeded to use recursion to arrive at the solution.\n\n\n### Onsite - 5 rounds\n\n##### Coding 1\n**Problem:** Given a set of characters, determine all English words that can be created.\nStarted the discussion on determining the inputs and outputs, the structure of the dictionary to validate against.\nBuilt a trie with the dictionary list and tested every permutation of the characters.\nOptimised it in a second approach by generating a HashSet for every anagram in the dictionary and checking against characters.\n\n\n##### System Design\nThis was not a generic design round at all.\nThe interviewer was a very experienced person who had worked with Apple for over 10 years.\nThe round focused primarily on my experience. He picked each of my experiences and we discussed very deeply about my entire task. Why I picked it, what I did (sketched multiple diagrams for each question), how I measured performance, what I would do differently today.\n\n\n##### Behavioral\nThis round was with a senior manager.\n**Question:** Given the values of Apple, such as Deep expertise and Drive for Excellence, how have you showcased these in your career?\nI started picking examples from my first job to my last job, highlighting the different lessons I had learnt - technical, cultural, and leadership.\n\nSome key lessons I highlighted were -\n- Keeping it simple (KISS).\n- Don't jump to solutioning too soon.\n- Respect everyone's expertise.\n- Resolving conflicts.\n- Motivating team members.\n\n\n##### Coding 2\n**Problem 1: **Given a dataset, sample n items while maintaining the original probability distribution.\nVery straightforward problem, the solution was to maintain the original counts and use random to sample.\n\n\n**Problem 2: **Create a React component that can display 1M records.\nThe problem required slicing the data and displaying only records that would fit within the scroll section.\nThis is a classic React interview problem.\nPractice Resource : https://www.greatfrontend.com/interviews/dashboard\nHad practiced questions from here which made this really easy to solve.\n\n\n##### Coding 3\nDiscussed my expertise in React. Then the interviewer drew a basic input UI and asked me to implement it.\nI showcased skills such as breaking down the UI into components, creating a higher order component, using UseEffect, UseMemo, and UseRef for functionality.\n\n---\n\n\nMailed the recruiter for feedback as I had just cleared Amazon and had made a decision soon.\nAfter continuous follow-up for 4 days got positive feedback.\nTook another 2 days for the verbal offer and another 4 days for the written offer.\n\nApparently, Apple startes interviewing for a role prior to receiving approval and requires 4 levels of signatures up to the VP level to roll out the offer.\n\nSo, anyone waiting on Apple, just keep following up as they as gonna take their own time!\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Offer\nI already had an offer from Amazon for SDE 2, and so the baseline was set.\nApple was **NOT** able to match my Amazon offer at IC3 level as I only had 4.5 YOE and didn't qualify for IC4 :(\n\n**Base:** 175K\n**Stock:** 33K / year\n**Sign On: **20k\n**Yearly Bonus: **7.5% = ~13k\n\n##### 1st Year TC: 241K\n**Amazon TC: 280K**\nAmazon Innterview - https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/6558499/amazon-interview-expereince-l5-seattle-b-vmpa/\n\nI still chose Apple as I didn't want to move to Seattle and deal with Amazon Culture.\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt took me **4 months and 72 interviews** to land my first Offer after being laid off.\n\n\nJust when all hopes were lost is when I landed 4 back-to-back offers and finally picked Apple!\n\n\nKeep grinding people. Everything eventually works out.\nLuck is as important as the hard work we put in. So, don't be discouraged if you are not getting callbacks or interviews are not converting. Its not your fault.\n\n\nStay positive!\nHappy to answer any questions!\n"}

There are two commonly used ways to compute `mid`:\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Using `(left + right) / 2`\r\n```cpp\r\nint mid = (left + right) / 2;\r\n```\r\nThis is the straightforward and intuitive way to calculate the middle index. However, in some programming languages where integers have a limited range (like C++ and Java), adding `left` and `right` directly might cause **integer overflow** if they are large values.\r\n\r\n### \u2705 Using `left + (right - left) / 2`\r\n```cpp\r\nint mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\r\n```\r\nThis avoids the potential **overflow issue** because we first subtract `left` from `right`, ensuring that we work with a smaller number before adding it back to `left`.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd39 Example in Binary Search\r\nHere\u2019s an example of a correct binary search implementation using the **safe mid calculation**:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nint binarySearch(int arr[], int n, int target) {\r\n    int left = 0, right = n - 1;\r\n\r\n    while (left <= right) {\r\n        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;\r\n        if (arr[mid] == target)\r\n            return mid;\r\n        else if (arr[mid] < target)\r\n            left = mid + 1;\r\n        else\r\n            right = mid - 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return -1; \r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11};\r\n    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);\r\n    int target = 7;\r\n\r\n    int index = binarySearch(arr, n, target);\r\n    if (index != -1)\r\n        cout << \"Element found at index: \" << index << endl;\r\n    else\r\n        cout << \"Element not found\" << endl;\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udd25 Conclusion\r\n- `mid = (left + right) / 2;` is simple but **might cause overflow**.\r\n- `mid = left + (right - left) / 2;` is the **recommended approach** to prevent overflow issues.\r\n\r\nAlways prefer the **safe version** when working with languages where integer overflow is a concern! \ud83d\ude80\r\n\r\n"}

Since have applied to Amazon for summer internship before, they had my email ID.\r\n\r\nJanuary 2025 (third week) - Got the OA link (medium)\r\n\r\nFirst Question (Easy) - It was a greedy question in which you needed to count the minimum health a player needs to survive.\r\nSecond question (Medium) - Sliding window + hashmap question.\r\nAfter DSA, it had the behaviorial part.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2025 (Second week) - Got the mail saying that I passed the OA and interviews will be scheduled soon.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2025 (Third week) - First interview round ( LP+DSA)\r\n\r\nStarted with each other's introduction and then 10 mins of Leadership Principles. He asked me 2 DSA questions.\r\n\r\nFirst question - Build a data structure which can insert, search, delete and get random element in O(1) time. There was a follow up asking what if there are duplicates in the input.\r\n\r\nSecond question - Find square root of a number. I gave basic binary search answer then he followed up asking what if we want the answer with say 8 place decimal precision.\r\n\r\nNeed to tell time and space complexity of all codes. Brownie points if you explain with a dry run as well.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2025 (last week) - Got a call for the second interview at 11:30 am saying they want to schedule it that day 2 pm.\r\n\r\nSecond Round (LP+DSA) - Started just like the first one with introduction and then 10 mins of Leadership Principles. He asked 2 DSA questions.\r\n\r\nFirst question - You are given the starting and ending times for ML models. Each model used a GPU to run. 4 GPUs make up 1 CPU. Find the minimum number of CPUs needed to run all the models. Basically this problem was a variation of the minimum number of platforms question. I followed with the line sweep algorithm first then he asked what if the time intervals are given in decimals then I told him the sorting+two pointers method.\r\n\r\nSecond Question - You are given a matrix full of 'S' and 'O'. Any 'O' or cluster of 'O' that are not covered by S from all directions become 'S' as well. We have to return the final state of the matrix. Basically any 'O' and the 'O' connected to it become\r\n'S' as they are not covered, so you run a DFS for all 'o' on the edges and convert them one by one to 'S'.

If so, should i negotiate much more on salary?because I feel I might be underpaid according to the market rate.\n\nWhat are the potential negative consequences of serving a 90-day notice period after just one month at the company?\n\n"}

Finally landed on one class for a Package(dependencies = List[Package]).\nAnother class PackageManager that determines the order of install for a set of Packages.\nBasic DFS solution with optimisation resulted in O(n) solution.\n\n\n#### Coding 2:\nDesign a cache for a search system that can have filters.\n\n**Outcome:** Problem was super vague and took me forever to clarify and get to the details. \nWas able to only code a very rough solution with lots of comments. The code was not fully functional, but I was able to explain every part of it and the assumptions and working of every function in the class. Used HashMap and Doubly Linked list\nBasically 4 concepts: Key determination, insert startegy, retrieval strategy and eviction startegy\nThis might have been the bar raiser mostly.

Got to the solution quickly. Explained code. \n\n\n#### System Design:\nThe problem was vague but as I discussed more I finally ended up designing an ETL system.\nHandled cases like long running loads, high scale, retries, logging, write performance, updates, monitoring.\n\nInterviewer was pleased with the final design.

It **emails you at the exact time you set**-whether it\u2019s **4 days, 15 days, or any custom interval**-so you don\u2019t have to rely on memory.  \r\n\r\nNow, instead of just **solving and moving on**, I **revisit hard or new concepts at the right time**, and it's made a big difference.  \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt like you\u2019re **forgetting problems too quickly**, you might find this useful too.

Both were at an easy-to-medium level and related to string manipulation. I was able to answer them.\n\nRound 3: (45 minutes)\nThis round went well. I was asked one DSA question, followed by questions related to my resume, some LLD (Low-Level Design), and HLD (High-Level Design) topics. Overall, it was manageable.\n\nRound 4: Bar Raiser Round\nThis was a deep dive into my resume. I was asked detailed questions about Redis, my past work experience, and reasons behind certain decisions. There were also some behavioral questions.\n\nA few days later, I received an offer.\n\n\n--> The tough part of this opportunity is not cracking the interview, but actually getting a call from HR.
