A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.
Example 1:
Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.
Example 2:
Input: word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
Output: false
