Given two string arrays word1 and word2, return true if the two arrays represent the same string, and false otherwise.
A string is represented by an array if the array elements concatenated in order forms the string.
Example 1:
Input: word1 = ["ab", "c"], word2 = ["a", "bc"]
Output: true
Explanation:
word1 represents string "ab" + "c" -> "abc"
word2 represents string "a" + "bc" -> "abc"
The strings are the same, so return true.
Example 2:
Input: word1 = ["a", "cb"], word2 = ["ab", "c"]
Output: false
Example 3:
Input: word1 = ["abc", "d", "defg"], word2 = ["abcddefg"]
Output: true
Constraints:
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 103
1 <= word1[i].length, word2[i].length <= 103
1 <= sum(word1[i].length), sum(word2[i].length) <= 103
word1[i] and word2[i] consist of lowercase letters.
