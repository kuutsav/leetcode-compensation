Decided to share my journey to help out this amazing community in these tough times \\u2764\\uFE0F\\n\\n**Fun college days with no internships nor coding**\\nI was really into sports so used to be on the field all the time so these things never came across my mind until after I graduated. Best takeaway was a computer science degree.\\n\\n**Debut at a Service Based Company**\\nLiterally zero companies came to our campus. Somehow got a job at TCS and was really happy. Still unaware about leetcode. \\n\\n**Decided to prepare for a top product based company**\\nStarted with Leetcode. Tried easy questions. Failed. Learnt all the data structures. Fundamental algos. Solved easy questions. Tried medium questions. Failed. Implemented all the data structures and algorithms learnt. Tried medium questions. Failed. Solved 3 and 4 point questions from virtual contests. Slowly progressing. Still after one year of this I couldn\\'t solve a given medium question. Back to drawing board.\\n\\n**Change of approach and focus**\\nI was doing a full time job also. I needed more hours everyday to prepare. Stopped everything. Focused on health and diet. Dropped sugar completely. Started leetcode again with a fresh mindset and energy. Got myself a digital pen that helped a ton. Every question I fail I\\'d retry in 3 weeks. Always kept a timer and always talked as if I was at an interview to get used to the pressure. Never viewed the topic before attempting a question. I want to be able to figure out if this is a Dp question or greedy. Followed this random guy Elite Code on yt he has these raw videos of him approaching unseen problems. Then learnt everything about backend engineering and honestly fell in love with it.    \\n\\n**Applying, networking and linkedin suspension**\\nEveryday I\\'d connect with people from target companies. Was getting referrals but wasn\\'t getting shortlisted. Possibly due to being from a no name college and service based company. Connected and requested more than a thousand people in hope. Instead I got suspension from linkedin because of spammy activity lol. This was like when the market was at it\\'s worst.\\n\\n**Change of approach and finally the breakthrough**\\nSomehow got the account back and changed my approach. Started to engage with people\\'s posts with genuine curiosity and love for software engineering. Small things like commenting would help with visibility and good networks. Leveraged this, with trying to get names of the recruiter or HM and contact them. Even request follow up to referrer at  times. Eventually got interview opportunities with many good product companies and was able to pass all. Was able to get offers upto 32L. Yoe is 2+. It came to a point where I had to decline interviews from good companies, as I was already content.\\n\\n**Overall essentials IMO \\uD83D\\uDCAF**\\n- Maintain a solid graph in your leetcode profile.\\n- Don\\'t over or under-prepare. If you can solve 5 pointer LC questions and some of the 6 pointers, go start applying. That\\'s a whole another game in itself too.\\n- Network as much as possible. That\\'s the only way.\\n- See what people from these companies are posting about on linkedin. Engage. These insights will be your differentiators when the interviewer asks \"do you have any questions for me\"\\n- There are too many things to cover but keeping it short here.\\n\\nHope it helps. \\n\\nEdit: those who\\'re connecting via linkedin rest assured I will get back to you sooner or later", "vote_count": 240, "comment_count": 119, "view_count": 9356, "creation_date": "2024-05-11 11:57:46"}

{"id": "5050062", "title": "Reverse Integer LeetCode Problem Solution in Python", "content": "Introduction:\\nHello everyone! In this post, I\\'ll be sharing my solution to the \"Reverse Integer\" problem on LeetCode using Python. This problem involves reversing the digits of a given integer.\\n\\nProblem Description:\\nGiven a 32-bit signed integer, reverse the digits of the integer.\\n\\nExample:\\nInput: 123\\nOutput: 321\\n\\nSolution:\\npython\\ndef reverse_integer(x):\\n    sign = -1 if x < 0 else 1\\n    x = abs(x)\\n    reverse = 0\\n    while x != 0:\\n        digit = x % 10\\n        reverse = reverse * 10 + digit\\n        x = x // 10\\n    reverse = reverse * sign\\n    if reverse < -231 or reverse > 231 - 1:\\n        return 0\\n    return reverse\\n\\n\\nExplanation:\\n1. We determine the sign of the input integer and store it.\\n2. We take the absolute value of the integer to work with positive numbers.\\n3. We iterate through each digit of the integer using a while loop.\\n4. For each digit, we extract it using modulo 10 and add it to the reverse after multiplying the reverse by 10 to shift digits left.\\n5. We update the integer by removing the last digit.\\n6. We multiply the reverse by the stored sign to restore the original sign of the integer.\\n7. We check if the reversed integer overflows, and if it does, we return 0.\\n8. Otherwise, we return the reversed integer.\\n\\nComplexity Analysis:\\n- Time complexity: O(log(x)) where x is the input integer\\n- Space complexity: O(1)", "vote_count": -3, "comment_count": 1, "view_count": 81, "creation_date": "2024-04-20 17:45:40"}

I dove headfirst into the problem, exploring different approaches and refining my code to ensure efficiency.\\n\\nHere\\'s a snippet of what I came up with:\\n\\n```#include <iostream>\\n#include <unordered_map>\\n\\nvoid countCharacterFrequency(const std::string& s) {\\n    // Initialize an unordered_map to store character frequencies\\n    std::unordered_map<char, int> charFrequency;\\n\\n    // Iterate through each character in the string\\n    for (char ch : s) {\\n        // Check if the character is already in the unordered_map\\n        if (charFrequency.find(ch) != charFrequency.end()) {\\n            // Increment the count if the character is already present\\n            charFrequency[ch]++;\\n        } else {\\n            // Add the character to the unordered_map with a count of 1 if it\\'s not present\\n            charFrequency[ch] = 1;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Print or process the result as needed\\n    std::cout << \"Character frequencies:\" << std::endl;\\n    for (const auto& pair : charFrequency) {\\n        std::cout << pair.first << \": \" << pair.second << std::endl;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nint main() {\\n    // Example usage\\n    std::string inputString = \"amla-commerce\";\\n    countCharacterFrequency(inputString);\\n\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis snippet utilizes a Map to keep track of the frequency of each character in the given string.

It was about reading a csv file and writing into a db tables. We had a very detailed discussion which went for 1.5 hours and interviewer seemed satisfied. I would say, I couldn\\'t answer all the questions but majority of them. Morever it was a very open ended interview with plethora of ways to answer it and I did well.\\n2nd Round: This interviewer just copy pasted a question of DP which unfortunately I had never attempted before. He didn\\'t want to discuss much on this and simply wanted an answer. I tried to give a solution which was not optimal but then decided to write a code anyway. No suggestions from his side other than one which was absolutely wrong.\\nWhen I was left with 20 mins, he asked to leave that problem and copy pasted another matrix multiplication of diagonals sum problem. I saw it and quickly wrote a working code in 5 mins. He tried to find error in my code but couldn\\'t. I then tried to rewrite the first problem but he seemed to have already made up his mind of rejecting which I could sense.

Upon discussing this with the recruiter, I was informed that due to my substantial current CTC, they upgraded the role and changed the location. I expressed a preference for Bengaluru due to personal reasons, and the recruiter mentioned she would discuss it with the hiring manager. However, she indicated that chances of changing the location are slim, and even if it happens, there won\\'t be any joining bonus. What should be my approach in this situation?\\n\\nMy total years of experience are 8, and my current CTC at Facebook is as follows:\\n\\nBase Pay: 48 lakhs\\nJoining Bonus: 10 lakhs\\nRSU: 350 stocks\\nI\\'d appreciate any advice or insights you can provide.

Disabling synchronization (sync_with_stdio(false)) can improve the performance of C++ input/output operations, as it eliminates the need for synchronization between C++ and C I/O.\\n\\ncin.tie(NULL);: By default, the C++ input stream (cin) is tied to the C++ output stream (cout). This means that when you perform an input operation using cin, it automatically flushes the output buffer of cout. Setting cin.tie(NULL) unties cin from cout, which can improve the performance by avoiding unnecessary flushing.\\n\\ncout.tie(NULL);: Similar to the previous line, this unties the C++ output stream (cout) from the C++ input stream (cin). This can also improve performance by avoiding unnecessary flushing.\\n\\nThese optimizations are often used in competitive programming or scenarios where performance is critical.

Was able to come up with an approach using monotonic stack which the interviewer said would work, only gave the psuedocode.\\n\\t*  Given a set of islands, return the number of groups of islands which are directly or indirectly connected to one another.

Later we had a long discussion on API design patterns, microservice communication mechanisms, database replication and sharding strategies, high availability, health monitoring and logging infra etc. Overall it was a very nice interaction.\\n\\n4. Design round (Chief architect, 1 hour):\\n\\t* \\tDiscussion on previous projects, couple of behaviour questions.
