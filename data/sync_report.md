## 11. Seeking for careeer decision || Urgent

### Raw Content
```
Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice on a career decision.

Background

Current company: MNC, product-based
Current CTC: ~12 LPA
Experience: 4.5 years
Have been working fully remotely in all my roles so far
Offers

Elsevier – Senior Software Engineer (Full-stack, backend-heavy)

Base: 22 LPA
15% fixed bonus
~1 LPA employer PF
Total CTC: ~26.3 LPA
Flexible work model, possible remote
Mature product company

Freshworks – Senior Software Engineer (Backend)

Base: 26 LPA
5–10% bonus on top
Total CTC: 28.6 LPA
Hybrid work model (3 days/week office)
Fast-growing SaaS product company

I enjoy learning in fast-paced teams while also valuing work-life balance and long-term job security. Since I’ve mostly worked remotely so far, I sometimes feel I might be missing out on in-office learning and collaboration, thoughts I do prefer remote work overall.

If anyone currently works at or has worked with Elsevier or Freshworks, I’d really appreciate your inputs on team culture, learning opportunities, work-life balance, and long-term growth.

Thanks in advance for your help.
