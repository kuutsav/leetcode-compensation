## 4. Oracle (OHAI) SMTS (IC3) vs LG Ads (Alphonso) SE-2 | Offer Comparison

### Raw Content
```
Hi all, 
I need advice for choosing between two offers & how to negotiate for Oracle Base/JB/stock increase with the LG Ads offer. (I am more inclined towards Oracle)

College: IIT (Non CSE)
Experience: 3 years 6 months
Current Comp: ₹31L (₹20L fixed + ₹11L RSUs each year)

**Offers:**

**Company: Oracle (OHAI)**
Title: Senior software engineer / SMTS
Location: Bengaluru
Work Mode: WFH

📦 Offer Breakdown:

Base (Fixed): ₹36L
RSU (stocks): $39.7k (~ ₹36L) (over 4 years)
Vesting schedule: 40% / 30% / 20% / 10%

💰 Total Compensation (Year 1)
= ₹36L (Fixed) + ₹14.3L (RSU)
= ₹50.3L (approx)

Vs

**Company: LG Ads (Alphonso)**
Title: Software Engineer - 2
Location: Bengaluru
Work Mode: WFO

📦 Offer Breakdown:

Base: 41.2L (₹40L Fixed + ₹1.2L Misc Allowance)
Performance Bonus (each year): Targeted 20% of fixed (₹8L), usually given (15% -> ₹6L)

💰 Total Compensation
= ₹48L (approx)

Questions:

1. Can someone tell me if there is a possibility to increase the base for OHAI offer. Earlier, HR told me for Base they can not go beyond 36. I am not sure if it is a Hard limit. Also, if not base, is there a possibility for JB or stock increase?
2. What would you suggest as a better choice here? I am a bit inclined towards Oracle for its Brand & future switch options to MAANG.
