## 3. URGENT || Senior SWE offer decision: Elsevier vs Freshworks 

### Raw Content
```
Hi everyone,

Looking for some advice on a career decision.

**Background**

* Current company: MNC, product-based
* Current CTC: ~12 LPA
* Experience: 4.5 years
* Have been working fully remotely in all my roles so far

**Offers**

**Elsevier – Senior Software Engineer (Full-stack, backend-heavy)**

* Base: 22 LPA
* 15% fixed bonus
* ~1 LPA employer PF
* Total CTC: ~26.3 LPA
* Flexible work model, possible remote
* Mature product company

**Freshworks – Senior Software Engineer (Backend)**

* Base: 26 LPA
* 5–10% bonus on top
* Total CTC: 28.6 LPA
* Hybrid work model (3 days/week office)
* Fast-growing SaaS product company

I enjoy learning in fast-paced teams while also valuing work-life balance and long-term job security. Since I’ve mostly worked remotely so far, I sometimes feel I might be missing out on in-office learning and collaboration, though I do prefer remote work overall.

If anyone currently works at or has worked with Elsevier or Freshworks, I’d really appreciate your inputs on team culture, learning opportunities, work-life balance, and long-term growth.

Thanks in advance for your help.
