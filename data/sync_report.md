## 2. MMT vs Joveo vs DP world

### Raw Content
```
College : NIT
Currenlty at Ecommerce with 19L
YOE: 2.6 years

**Offers in hand (first year compensation)**:
• MoEngage SDE1– ₹31L TC
• DP World Group SDE1 – ₹35L TC (Zodiac team)
 Joveo remote sde1- 30L first year comp
• MMT sse1– ₹24L TC
• Another similar company sse – ₹27L TC


Coming from a very bad work culture (8:30 office login, no WFH, heavy micromanagement). I want to join a tech-first company — mainly considering MoEngage or DP World.

Reviews for DP World are quite negative, so wanted to understand how bad it actually is and whether it’s team-dependent (specifically Zodiac team).

Looking for honest inputs on culture, micromanagement, and survivability.

Will be posting all experiences shortly

## 6. Nike (SDE 1) vs Deloitte (Retention) | 3.5 YOE | India | Need Career Advice

### Raw Content
```
Education: B.Tech (Tier 2/3)
Years of Experience: 3.5 Years
Current Role: Senior Analyst at Service Based MNC (Deloitte)
Current Location: Hometown (Remote/Hybrid)
I am currently in a dilemma between joining a product-based company for better career growth vs. staying in my current service-based firm for financial stability. Please guide me.

Offer 1: Nike (India Technology Center)
* Role: SDE 1
* Location: Bangalore
* Fixed Base: ₹13 LPA
* Total CTC (PSP + PF + NPS): ~₹15.3 LPA
* Pros: Brand name, "Product" company tag, Tech stack improvement.
* Cons: Relocation to Bangalore (High COL), SDE 1 title (feels junior for 3+ YOE?), Offer seems low for standard product companies.

Offer 2: Deloitte (Current Employer - Retention Offer)
* Role: Consultant
* Location: Hometown (Low COL)
* Total CTC: ₹15 LPA
* Pros: Higher in-hand savings (no rent/mess expenses), comfort of home, known environment.
* Cons: Service-based company tag, slower technical growth, might get stuck in legacy projects.

The Conflict:
Financially, Deloitte is the clear winner. Moving to Bangalore for ₹15.3 LPA means paying rent, deposit, and higher living costs, which will drop my savings significantly.
However, I am worried that if I stay at Deloitte, I will be pigeonholed as a "Service Company Developer" and finding product roles later will be harder.

My Questions to the Community:
1. Is ₹15.3 LPA a lowball for an SDE 1 at Nike Bangalore with 3.5 YOE? (I tried negotiating, but HR said this is final).
2. Is it worth taking a "savings cut" to get the Nike brand name on my resume?
3. Does the SDE 1 tag at 3.5 YOE hurt future switch prospects?

Any advice on which path to choose for long-term growth would be appreciated!

Edit 1:
For reference, my current CTC is low. Nike is technically offering 100% hike here.
