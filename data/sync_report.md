## 5. Meta Blr E4 Offer

### Raw Content
```
Current TC - top MNC, 82 lpa(because of stock appreciation), 4.5 yoe

Meta offer:- 

45 base + 160k USD stocks + 7l Joining bonus ~ 88 lpa for first year

I have a competing offer from a startup for 60 + 20 lpa.
Seems like a lowball to me. I have seen 1cr+ offers for Meta Blr E4 on the internet, but the recruiter is not budging.

## 11. Microsoft Offer Discussion - L62

### Raw Content
```
Hi everyone,

I recently received an offer from Microsoft and would like to get community opinions on whether it’s a good move.

```
YOE: 6.5 years
Current Location: Bengaluru
Offer Location: Hyderabad
```

```
Current Compensation (Bengaluru)

Base: ₹43 LPA

Approx TC: ~₹55–58 LPA (market dependent)

Microsoft Offer (L62 – Hyderabad)

Level: L62

Base: ₹41 LPA (includes employer PF contribution)

Bonus: Up to 20% (target-based)

Joining Bonus: ₹8 L total over 2 years

RSUs: $100k over 4 years

Year-1 TC (approx): ~₹72–75 LPA (depending on stock price & bonus payout)

```
**My Questions**
- Is L62 a fair level for 6.5 YOE at Microsoft India?

- How does this offer compare to market for Hyderabad vs Bengaluru?
- Is the base being lower than current base (but higher total comp) a concern?

- Would this be considered a good long-term move assuming 3–4 years at Microsoft?

- Any advice on whether light negotiation (RSUs / sign-on) is still worth trying?

Would really appreciate inputs from folks who have seen or experienced Microsoft India offers. As i have joining in few weeks.

Thanks in advance!
