## 5. SDE-1 AMAZON ON CONTRACT BASIS FOR 1 YEAR...

### Raw Content
```
Hi folks,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would love some advice.

I got an offer from Amazon India for an SDE-1 role, but it’s a 1-year fixed-term contract. Salary is around 20 LPA, Bangalore.

I’m currently working as a Data Engineer, earning around 25k/month, and this will be my first proper SDE role.

I’ve heard mixed things about contract roles, so I’m worried:

Are conversions really rare?

Is it risky to leave a stable job for this?

If conversion doesn’t happen, is this experience still valuable?

Also, since I’ve mostly worked in data engineering, I’m a bit rusty with core development skills.

What should I focus on preparing before joining to perform well as an SDE?

Anyone with real experience, please share. It will really help me decide. Thanks!

## 13. How significant is a jump in fixed pay

### Raw Content
```
Current Compensation : 14.2 Fixed + 8LPA shares :: 22LPA
CCTC maximum in last 2 years: 14.2 + 12LPA when share increased by 33% :: 26LPA
Current job: Complete remote
