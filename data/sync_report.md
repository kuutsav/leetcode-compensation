I think I lowballed myself, I asked for 28 base and they said yes without any negotiation.

Should I call them back and ask for more? Need the community advice, never did salary negotiations before.

## 9. Microsoft Engineer | This market is beyond cooked | Rant

### Raw Content
```
I work at Microsoft.
3.5 YOE. L60. Core portal team. Full-stack dev. Good review, good visibility, zero hope of promotion. Everyone knows the ladder here moves slower than a Windows update.

I’ve applied to 300+ jobs at this point. google, uber, atlassian, random startups, whatever.
got a few calls, then nothing. just straight up ghosted. no feedback, no rejection, nothing.

google recruiters hit me up like 4 times in the last 3 months. sounds good right? 
Nope.
every time it’s android role, android domain round, in person. I’m full-stack, I don’t do android. 

I told them clearly: I’m not an Android dev. I’m full-stack. I don’t touch android. I can’t become Google-level Android engineer in 4 weeks preperation to pass a domain round face-to-face. That’s just unrealistic.

Then a friend gave me a referral. Applied to FullStack and backend roles, Soon enough I recieved a mail:
“we will contact you soon for a FULLSTACK role!”

I was genuinely happy for like 5 minutes.

Call happens.
Guess what? Android role again. Domain round again.

At this point I’m convinced my resume auto-routes to Android hiring pipeline no matter what I apply for.

lets take about uber now,
applied via refferal, recruiter calls, hypes up the team, says they’re looking for strong backend/full-stack.
Says they’ll schedule rounds next week.
Next week comes, recruiter says “headcount on hold, but we’ll keep you updated.”
Two weeks later I get an auto-rejection email. No interviews. No explanation. just vibes-based hiring.

stripe was another joke. same as uber. recruiter said they’ll schedule interviews for some AI platform team. I was like okay lessgooo.
that was 3 weeks ago. no scheduling, no replies to follow-up mails. just vanished. hell nah.

salesforce at least gave an offer.
28 base + stocks, lower than my overall current comp. tried to negotiate politely, that rude ass HR said take it or leave it and cut the call in 4-5 minutes. May his soul rot in hell, completly unprofessional.

what is this market.

Anyway, back to solving LC hard and pretending everything is fine.
maybe DP will fix my life.

## 14. Alteryx || SDE 2 || Compansation || 

### Raw Content
```
Hi everyone,

I have 3 years of experience and am currently working at a good product-based company with the following compensation:


Current CTC:
Base: 14 LPA
Profit Share: 1.16 LPA
Bonus: 30K per year

Recently, I received an offer from Alteryx for an SDE-2 role with the following breakup:

Alteryx Offer:
Base: 28 LPA
PF: 1.64 LPA
Bonus: 10% of base = 2.8 LPA
Wellness Fund: 30K per year
Cab/Travel Reimbursement: ₹7,600 per month

Offer In-Hand
I also have another product-based company offer, which looks like this:

Offer 2:
Base: 29 LPA
Bonus: 8% of base = 2.64 LPA
PF: 1.72 LPA

Although Alteryx is offering a slightly lower base compared to the second offer, the overall compensation is still competitive.

My question is:

Should I negotiate with Alteryx for a higher base, because i saw Alteryx was given more base than this in past for this exp or
Should I go ahead and accept the offer as is?

Would really appreciate insights from people who have faced similar situations or have experience negotiating at this level.

Thanks in advance! 🙌
```
