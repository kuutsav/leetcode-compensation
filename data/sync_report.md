## 1. Salesforce | MTS | Compensation

### Raw Content
```
For detailed breakdown you can have a look on my previous post - https://leetcode.com/discuss/post/7558469/salesforce-vs-bitgo-compensation-by-jeth-holo/

Update - recruiter has agreed to a BLR location but reduced my base compensation from 33L to 32L and my current loc is BLR only hence no relocation bonus.

I negotiated with him but he's not ready to budge and giving me warnings like if you negotiate for 1L your offer will go on hold and opening might get closed and all and saying you shouldn't do this as you want blr loc we don't give this much base to MTS we offer 28L etc.

recruiter is very clever in manipulating and he has reasoning for all my counters, i mean i am not asking for his dad's money.

i hope he's reserved his place in hell for not giving me what i deserve.

need your help guys in choosing.

Thanks in advance!

## 4. Slice Offer - Pathetic HR Expierence

### Raw Content
```
Hi all,
I want to share my disappointing experience with HR at Slice. After successfully completing all interview rounds and considerable follow-up, I received a significantly lower offer than initially discussed.

Initial discussion: ₹45L base + ₹10L ESOPs
Offer received: ₹40L base + ₹10L ESOPs (No Negotiation, 0 hike)
Position: Backend SDE-2

Key issues I encountered:

HR was unwilling to negotiate despite my providing evidence that joining bonuses had been offered to other candidates. I was told this wasn't their practice.

I was repeatedly pressured to reduce my notice period before receiving a formal offer letter. When I explained I couldn't discuss this with my manager without an offer in hand, HR refused and delayed the process considerably. When the offer letter was finally released—only after I was told I would be "blacklisted" if I didn't join—it was backdated with an unrealistically early joining date.

HR also mentioned they maintain records of all candidates who receive offers, which felt like an intimidation tactic.
While I was genuinely interested in the opportunity, feedback from multiple sources about the work culture—combined with my own experience with HR—raised serious concerns. Even at a lateral move compensation-wise, I ultimately declined the offer.

Additional note: The relocation allowance is ₹30K, which must cover flights, temporary accommodation, and moving expenses. Hotel stays are not provided separately.

I had heard that Slice's HR team tends to lowball candidates, but the lack of professionalism I experienced was unexpected. I felt treated as a number rather than a person.

Also, I would like to believe this an individual incident and not company's normalised image.

HR also mentioned they have a high offer dropout rate—I now understand why.

## 6. Need Advice: DigitalOcean vs JPMC Offer (4 YOE)

### Raw Content
```
YOE: 4
Current Company: DigitalOcean
Current Compensation:
Base: 25 LPA
RSUs: ~8 LPA/year
Variable: 7.5%
Work Mode: Hybrid (very flexible)
WLB: Very good

Offer Received: JPMorgan Chase
Fixed: 36 LPA
Bonus: ~12% (not explicitly mentioned in offer letter)
Work Mode: 4 days WFO (likely moving to 5 days)

Concern:
On comparing the total compensation, the overall CTC doesn’t seem to increase significantly—most of the jump is only in base pay. On top of that, the work mode is much more restrictive.

I’ve also heard mixed (often negative) feedback about WLB at JPMC, especially compared to product companies.

Questions:

Does switching make sense in this case?
Is the JPMC brand value worth the potential WLB trade-off?
Or would it be better to hold and target stronger product companies with higher upside?

Would appreciate insights from people who’ve worked at JPMC or made similar switches.

## 9. Offer Evaluation: HashedIn vs Experian vs EY

### Raw Content
```
Current Experience: 2.7 years
Role: Java Developer
CCTC: 5 LPA


Need help from the Leetcode community to evaluate the following offers.

Offer 1:  HashedIn by Deloitte
Role: SDE-2 (Java)
CTC: 13.5 LPA (11 fixed)


Offer 2: Experian
Role: Product Engineer (Backend/Java)
CTC: 14 LPA (13 fixed)


Offer 3: EY
Role: Applicaton Engineer (Java + AWS)
CTC: 12 LPA



I have a few concerns and would appreciate advice:

I’ve heard that Product Engineer roles at Experian receive comparatively lower hikes, and I’m also unsure about the long-term impact of the “Product Engineer” title. Does the title make a significant difference later in the career?

My main priorities are work-life balance and career growth.


Context:

I already have a 4.5 month career gap after resigning without an offer.

I’m still in interview loops with a few better companies, but I don’t know how long that process may take.


 Really appreciate any guidance and help from the community.


Rephrased using ChatGPT.

## 18. Early Startup vs MNC

### Raw Content
```
Hi, I'm an IIT grad with 6 months of experience. I have offer to join a very early stage AI startup (which currently has only 3 people). I am currently at a settled job.

### Compensation Details:

Current Job- 11.25 lakhs (all in hand) [Remote]
Startup - 14 lakhs(in hand)+ 1% esops (worth 16 lakhs) [Remote]

Since the pay difference is not very huge and startup will have more workload, is it really worth switching now? I have an alternate plan to stay at current and prep for a big tech and switch in mext 6-8 months. The only factor which drives me towards startup is the real impactful learning I'd have there. Do share your opinion

Hi everyone,

Looking for advice on negotiating an Apple offer and deciding whether switching makes sense.

Background

Total experience: ~4.5 years

**Apple Opportunity (ICT3)**


CTC: ₹54L is what they mentioned. I haven't negotiated yet. Need advise on that.


**Questions**

How much negotiation room typically exists for Apple ICT3 in India and best way to negotiate?

Does switching so soon after joining Salesforce hurt long-term optics?
